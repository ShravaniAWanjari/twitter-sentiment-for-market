"üö®COUP UPDATES: Putin Reportedly Leaves Moscow | Machine Gun Positions Around Moscow | Wagner Convoy Heads to Moscow

As the coup continues, here's the latest updates from our various sources live on the ongoing Twitter Space:

- Worries of the Russian Nuclear Warheads moved to Belarus weeks ago

- Wagner forces continue their advance to Moscow with limited strikes by the Russian Air Force

- Reports of Putin and other officials leaving Moscow and heading to Saint Petersburg based on the movement of Military VIP aircrafts. TASS, which is Gov controlled media outlet, reported that Putin is heading to Saint Petersburg, but Putin's Press Secretary refuted those reports. It is very unusual and rare to see such a disconnect between TASS and the Kremlin.

MY THOUGHTS:

- This is a military coup, we can no longer dispute this, and things are moving VERY rapidly and are not looking good for Putin.

- We are seeing limited military clashes, showing likely defections among Russian forces

- Almost EVERYTHING right now can't be verified and should be taken with a grain of salt

"Why the FBI And Democrats Are Attacking Whistleblowers

FBI says it won‚Äôt release Jan 6 surveillance video because it would show too many undercover government agents and informants

by @galexybrane & @shellenberger 

The FBI whistleblowers who testified before Congress today are not actually whistleblowers, say the FBI and Democrats. Rather, they are disloyal Americans who undermined investigations into the January 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.

‚ÄúMy [Republican] colleagues have brought in these former agents, men who lost their security clearances because they were a threat to our national security,‚Äù said Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-V.I.), the ranking member of the House weaponization subcommittee. ‚ÄúWho out of malice or ignorance or both have put partisan agenda above the oath they swore to serve this country.‚Äù

But there is no evidence that any of the FBI whistleblowers are or were ever a threat to national security. One of them, Marcus Allen, won two medals fighting in Iraq and Kuwait. Another, Garret O‚ÄôBoyle, served in the Army in Iraq, worked as a police officer, and graduated with honors in criminology and law.

Democrats pointed out that the FBI had revoked the security clearances of two whistleblowers, Allen, and Steve Friend, earlier this month. That news came in a letter that Christopher Dunham, the acting assistant director of the FBI, sent to the House Judiciary Committee last night.

The FBI claimed that Allen ‚Äúexpressed sympathy for persons or organizations that advocate, threaten, or use force or violence, or use any other illegal or unconstitutional means, in an effort to prevent federal government personnel from performing their official duties.‚Äù

But neither FBI nor Democrats presented evidence that Allen, Friend, or the other FBI whistleblowers who testified participated or even sympathized with the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol Building. ‚ÄúI was not in Washington D.C on January 6, played no part in the events of January 6, and I condemn all criminal activity that occurred,‚Äù said Allen.

Others suggested the FBI agents were exaggerating. ‚ÄúYou all have employment grievances,‚Äù said Rep. Gerald Connolly. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make you whistleblowers‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre listening to sad tales of certain individuals,‚Äù said Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. ‚ÄúThese individuals have been determined not to be whistleblowers.‚Äù

But the FBI agents testifying followed the legally required whistleblower protocols within the FBI and were not fringe agents. Allen, for example, was the 2019 Employee of the Year for the Charlotte Field Office.

Friend, a Special Agent at the FBI for eight and half years, O‚ÄôBoyle, and Allen all said they made protected whistleblower disclosures and yet were retaliated against by the FBI. Allen was suspended without pay in January 2022. O‚ÄôBoyle was transferred to a new unit, moved his family across the country, and was placed on an unpaid suspension the first day he arrived.

For decades after the FBI was caught spying on Martin Luther King, Jr. and abusing its powers for political ends, Democrats emphasized strong constraints on domestic spying and the importance of whistleblowers. Now, Democrats are savaging these former public servants as threats to national security. Why is that?

"ELON: WE‚ÄôLL NEED TERABIT-LEVEL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN EARTH AND MARS

‚ÄúWe're going to need terabit-level communication between Earth and Mars, which necessarily means that you want to have a tight beam, like a laser communication system or something like that with relay satellites.

Because sometimes Mars is on the other side of the Sun, so you've got to bounce the photons around the Sun, not through.

So, communication is definitely going to be important.

Also, I think that on Earth, there's a lot of potential for space-based communications. 

I think that there's a huge amount of room to grow for having satellite communication systems that provide high-bandwidth, global coverage.

""I said that can't be true, and then four months later, it was in the NYT buried in the middle of the paper, and I kept seeing stories like that that he would be early on. So, I started feeling more uncomfortable and queasy with what was going on with mainstream media.""

""Then, in May 2024, I read an article that talked about Trump's speech in Charlottesville, where he said there are good people on both sides, and the article said it was completely propaganda and didn't actually reflect what he said. That he denounced the Nazis a bunch of times in his speech, so then I went and watched that video, and that was my red pill moment."" 

""I think it was for a lot of people because it wasn't just the media or politicians spinning it. That speech was one of the pillars of why you were supposed to hate Trump. Then you see Biden say that's why he had to run a second time, and Obama says it, and Biden brings it up again at the DNC."" 

""They clearly know they are misrepresenting things, so for me, that was beyond uncomfortable. Now, I have to go back to first principles and look at the primary data, listen to only original speeches by people, and I just realized I couldn't trust the mainstream media.""

"Here's Elon Musk explaining how to advance technology in big companies and government.

‚ÄúIf you want to advance technology, you've got to recruit the world's best engineers and then create an environment that enables them to be as innovative as possible.

You need to really reward and encourage innovation and punish lack of innovation.

It's got to be both, stick and carrot. Ideally, more carrot than stick.

In a lot of companies, you have a risk-reward asymmetry, where bold moves are punished if they go wrong.

But keeping your head down is not punished. That's not good. That will result in a very conservative outcome.

It has to be a requirement that there is significant advancement, and simply the lack of doing something significant is bad.

Big companies just become really conservative over time. Really, the government is a company in the limit. The government is the biggest company.‚Äù

"Elon Musk: I found meaning in the idea that we should preserve and expand consciousness, and explore the universe.

‚ÄúWhen I was a teenager, I had an existential crisis to try to figure out what's the meaning of life. There didn't seem to be any meaning. For me, at least, the religious texts that I read, all of them that I get my hands on, did not seem convincing.

Then I started reading philosophers. Be careful of reading German philosophers as a teenager. It's definitely not going to help with your depression.

Reading Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, as an adult, it's much more manageable. But as a kid, you're like, whoa... I was just struggling to find meaning in life here.

And then, I read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and basically what Douglas Adams was saying is that we don't really know what the right questions are to ask.

In the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Earth is a big computer, and its goal is to answer the question what's the meaning of life? And Earth comes up with the answer 42.

In that book, which is really an existential philosophy book disguised as humor, they come to the conclusion that the real problem is trying to formulate the question.

And to really have the right question, you need a much bigger computer than Earth.

One way of characterizing this would be to say the universe is the answer, what is the question? What are the questions?

The more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, the better we can understand what questions to ask about the answer, that is the universe.

The more we can expand consciousness, become a multiplanet species, ultimately a multistellar species, we have a chance of figuring out what the hell's going on.

This is why I think we should have more humans and more biological and digital consciousness. And why we should become a multiplanet species and a multistellar species so that we can understand the nature of the universe.

In order for that to occur, we have to make sure that things are good on Earth. We don't want Earth to disappear. So, sustainable energy is important for ensuring the long-term viability of Earth. And making life multiplanetary is important for extending consciousness.

Ultimately, we want to go and visit other star systems to see if there are alien civilizations there that perhaps still exist or perhaps died out millions of years ago.‚Äù

"Grok explains 

The case you're referring to involves a 20-year-old woman from Hamburg, Germany, named Maja R., who was sentenced to a weekend in jail for defaming one of the men convicted in a gang rape case. Here's a breakdown based on the available information:

- **Sentencing Details**: Maja R. was sentenced to a weekend in jail after she insulted one of the rapists via WhatsApp, calling him a ""disgraceful rapist pig"" and a ""disgusting freak."" The rapist she insulted received a suspended sentence, meaning he did not serve time in jail. 

- **Context of the Rape Case**: The gang rape incident occurred in 2020 in Hamburg, involving nine men aged 16 to 20 who were convicted of raping a 15-year-old girl. Due to their age at the time of the crime, they were subject to juvenile law, which generally results in lighter sentences. Eight of these men received suspended sentences, while one, an Iranian national, was sentenced to actual imprisonment (two years and nine months in a youth prison).

- **Why Maja R.'s Sentence Was Longer**: 
  - **Legal Reasons**: German law has strict defamation laws which criminalize causing offense, even with what might be considered mild insults. Maja R. was charged under these laws for her remarks. Her sentence was influenced by her prior conviction for theft and her failure to attend court hearings, which might have been seen as aggravating factors by the court.
  
  - **Juvenile Law**: The rapists, being under 20 at the time of the crime, were treated under juvenile law, which focuses more on rehabilitation than punishment, leading to suspended sentences or shorter terms in youth facilities rather than adult prisons.

- **Public Reaction and Legal Critique**: This case has sparked significant public outrage due to the perceived disparity in sentencing between the rapists and Maja R. Critics argue that it highlights flaws in the German judicial system, particularly in how defamation is treated compared to violent crimes like rape. There's also concern over whether the judicial response aligns with public sentiment regarding the severity of the crimes committed versus the punishment for speaking out against them.

- **Investigations**: Following this case, Hamburg authorities are investigating around 140 more individuals for similar offenses of insulting or threatening the convicted rapists, indicating a broader legal response to public reactions.

This scenario has indeed led to discussions about the balance between freedom of speech and defamation laws in Germany, as well as the application of juvenile law in serious criminal cases.[](https://t.co/Z5MRuqo88y)[](https://t.co/6CLWMaqL6j)[](https://t.co/lAiVRxu7Nx)[](https://t.co/b1BoIswynr)[](https://t.co/6plV5YgIHT)",2025-01-12 01:01:18+00:00
"True story: @Grok diagnosed my daughter‚Äôs broken wrist last week. 

One of my daughters was in a bad car accident last weekend. Car is totaled but she walked away. Everyone involved did, thankfully. It was a best case outcome for a serious, multi-vehicle freeway collision.  

There was no need for emergency transport from the scene but her arm was hurting badly by the time we were able to leave (9pm-ish) so I took her home with the intention of visiting Urgent Care early the next morning. 

Well, ofc she didn‚Äôt sleep and by 6am, I was convinced it was broken. The way she was favoring it and the amount of pain she was in indicated more than soft tissue injury.

So we got to Urgent Care and they examined her and took some x-rays.  Both  the doctor who saw her and the radiologist declared her free of breaks and, after answering some of our questions, sent her home with an ace wrap and ibuprofen.

On the way out, I asked them to please print out the X-ray images for us so I could take them to her PCP.

I hoped they were right, but wasn‚Äôt sold.

At home, things were rough.  Her hand kept going cold and tingly and she couldn‚Äôt move her thumb ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt know how to describe it, but it just didn‚Äôt *look* right.  

She had other aches and pains too ‚Äî including two bruised ribs and some minor whiplash ‚Äî but the arm pain just kept breaking through.  

So, as soon I was able, I opened my laptop and started ‚Äúdoing my own research.‚Äù  

I poured over x-rays of normal wrists and broken wrists and, remembering a post from a few weeks ago by @elonmusk that Grok2 could read medical images, I uploaded the wrist X-ray to Grok and asked if there were any abnormalities.

Grok: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a clear fracture line in the distal radius.‚Äù

üëÄ

I had actually asked the doctor about the line Grok mentioned and he said it was just her growth plate.  So I asked Grok if it was seeing a fracture line or a fused growth plate.

Grok: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fracture line.‚Äù

üëÄ

Finally, I asked if this was a subtle fracture or obvious.  I really wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to the doctor.

Grok: ‚Äúquite obvious‚Äù

üëÄ

Long story short, we went to PCP, got a referral to the ortho, and the next day the wrist specialist took new x-rays (multiple views), examined her, and confirmed Grok‚Äôs diagnosis of a distal radial head fracture with dorsal displacement. 

(And, FTR, I didn‚Äôt tell the doctor about my foray into Grok, largely because I didn‚Äôt want her to think I was insane. Her diagnosis was completely independent.)

They set it and cast it.

The Starmer regime is scrambling as the British public begins to wake up to the fraudulent and authoritarian agenda of his government.

Today, my country, the UAE, placed 19 individuals and entities on its Local Terrorist List for their direct ties to the terrorist organization Muslim Brotherhood. Shockingly, these groups operate freely in Britain under Keir Starmer's watch. The West must realize that Islamists are evolving, living among you, learning your expectations, and waiting for the right moment to strike.

For example, Islamist terrorists now use deceptive names like ""Cambridge Education and Training Center Ltd.,"" which my country has banned but the UK has not. This so-called ""Cambridge Education and Training Center Ltd."" is an Islamist front exploiting education to turn your children into hostages of Hamas Gaza-like propaganda, using your city‚Äôs proud name to spread racism and antisemitism, poisoning minds under the guise of learning. Astonishingly, your government allows Cambridge‚Äôs name to be tarnished by hate.

Why is the London police not investigating these dangerous Islamists, who hide behind corporate fronts like Yas for Investment and Real Estates LTD and Holdco UK Properties Limited? They are buying properties, displacing citizens, and maybe opening the door for former Al-Qaeda members and illegal immigrants to seize control of your city.

The UAE has banned the Muslim Brotherhood because we recognize them for what they truly are: breeders of extremism, the root from which Hamas, Al-Qaeda, and ISIS emerged. How many more warnings will it take before you stop prioritizing political correctness over your people‚Äôs safety?

A terrorist in the West is a terrorist in the East, North, and South. Do not make him a property seller or an educator. No one plants a poisonous seed and expects to harvest good fruit. Wisdom teaches us that evil breeds evil; delay in action only strengthens its roots.

"Seven questions: 

1) Are British politicians importing an alien culture and an alien people in such numbers as to effectively render the young native British an ethnic minority in the near future?

2) Is the core ideology and culture of the millions of imported people antithetical to the core ideology and culture of modern Western democracies?

3) Have British politicians introduced legislation conferring an inferior status upon the native British and a superior status / protected class to the imported people and their alien culture?

4) If so, would not logic, the nature of man, and much chronicled history suggest this will inevitably lead to ever-increasing racial/cultural division and a highly probable physical clash of civilisations directly affecting our children and grandchildren?

5) If so, would it be fair to say our politicians are engaged in an ideological alliance with an imported foreign invasion and are thus guilty of treason in the specific legal definition?

6) If so, would it be fair to say British politicians are engaged in a genocidal war against their own citizens, according to the U.N. definition of genocide?

Elon on his part voluntarily sold Tesla stock in 2021, although he didn't have to in order to pay (a record amount) of income tax. Elon refuses to use tax loopholes. He also got involved in a presidential campaign to improve regulations for all citizens instead of trying to avoid bad regulation.

4. Cynicism vs Morality

And George Soros on business: ‚ÄúI don't feel guilty because I'm engaged in an amoral activity which is not meant to have anything to do with guilt.‚Äù

Elon Musk: ‚ÄúI want to be useful. I want to be able to look back and say that my actions had a good effect on the world.‚Äù

Also Elon Musk: ‚ÄúI have a huge respect for anyone who puts in an honest day's work, contributing to society. That's what matters.‚Äù

From Brexit to U.S. elections, George Soros has made a habit of throwing his billions into political causes that align with his agenda.

His Open Society Foundations bankroll everything from activist groups to media watchdogs, giving him a backdoor to influence policies worldwide.

In the U.S., Soros funds Media Matters for America, a progressive group targeting conservative media.

It doesn't stop there! Wikimedia, the company that owns Wikipedia, received at least three grants from Soros' Foundation‚Äîone of them for $330,000.

It also granted over $350,000 to the pro-DEI, anti-Brexit European Movement UK.

Soros calls it ""promoting democracy,"" but funding campaigns, media, and political organizations feels more like interference.

They didn't. 

Now Starmer, who was Director of Public Prosecutions during the crisis, blocks a statutory inquiry.

"üö®üá¨üáßLABOUR BLOCKS CHILD RAPE GANG INQUIRY TO HIDE ITS SHAMEFUL PAST

Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips' refusal for a public inquiry into child rape gangs shows Labour is desperate to bury its complicity in years of horrific abuse. 

Survivors demanded justice for crimes ignored by authorities, but Phillips continues to insist that a local review is enough - a move critics see as a blatant cover-up.

Labour has a dark history of turning a blind eye to grooming scandals. 

From Rotherham to Rochdale to Telford, Labour-run councils and police forces ignored or suppressed abuse allegations to avoid upsetting ‚Äúcommunity cohesion.‚Äù 

Vulnerable girls paid the price, enduring unspeakable horrors while Labour politicians prioritized their reputation and voter base.

In Rotherham, victims were doused in petrol, brutally raped, and silenced with threats, while Labour councilors silenced whistleblowers and downplayed abuse to avoid being labeled ‚Äúracist.‚Äù

In Telford, over 1,000 girls were abused, with police and councils turning a blind eye to avoid accusations of racism.

In Oldham, as in other towns, Labour leaders failed to act on abuse warnings, fearing backlash from their ‚Äúmulticultural‚Äù voter base.

By blocking a full inquiry, Labour isn't just avoiding accountability - it‚Äôs abandoning survivors all over again. 

If they have nothing to hide, why are they so terrified of the truth?

"I feel like many people still don‚Äôt quite understand the level of depravity inflicted on those little girls ‚Äî or just how young they were.

Think of your sister, daughter, or granddaughter as a child. Picture them. Think of how young and vulnerable they were.

Vicky Round was 12.
Becky Watson was 11.
Charlene Downes was 11 or 12.
Sammy Woodhouse was 14.
Victoria Agoglia was 13.
Sarah Wilson was 11.
And there are countless more.

They were children. Many barely out of primary school, so young and in no way responsible for the atrocities committed against them. 

Think about what gangs of Pakistani-Muslim men put those little girls through. Now imagine it was your sister, daughter or granddaughter.

Pakistani-Muslim grooming gangs plied them with alcohol and drugs, they raped them in graveyards, they put them into the back of taxis and drove them to be gang-raped by 20+ of their friends, they dismembered them and sold them as kebab meat, they inserted a pump into their anal cavity and had multiple men sodomise them at once, they raped them on filthy mattresses above takeaway shops, they forced panties down their throat to muffle the screams, they threatened to murder them if they told anyone, they brutally beat them, they killed them and torched their houses with their family inside, they picked them up from local authority care homes to be raped, they forced them to take crack cocaine and heroin, they convinced them they loved them so they could abuse them, they killed their unborn children, they targeted the most vulnerable and marginalised, they told them no one would believe them, they forced them to get abortions, they passed them round like a piece of meat, they threatened to kill their families, they gaslit and manipulated them.

And that is just a fraction of the abuse inflicted by Pakistani-Muslim grooming gangs in Telford, Rochdale, Rotherham, Oldham and elsewhere. That is just a tiny percentage of the horror that thousands of little girls faced at the hands of their abusers.

Now think about the people that were meant to protect them. Who comes to mind? Police, local councils, social services, sexual health clinics, schools, care homes.

But they didn‚Äôt.

Those in positions of power turned a blind eye for decades while little girls were being raped, tortured, and murdered.

They branded them ‚Äúwhite slags‚Äù, ‚Äúchild prostitutes‚Äù, and ‚Äúpaki shaggers‚Äù. They walked in on victims naked and drugged with 20+ adult men and only arrested the child, they arrested girls for prostitution and handed them back to the same men that were exploiting them, they added the victims to dockets as co-defendants in their own abuse, they downplayed the scale of abuse, they refused to investigate reports, they paid for the taxi rides the girls got raped during, they silenced whistleblowers (like @MaggieOliverUK), they blamed the girls for their own abuse, they tried to block inquiries, and more.

What drove these mainly Pakistani men to commit such atrocities with seemingly no fear of the consequences? ALL cultural/religious reasons must be explored.

Put people under oath, compel them to appear, force them to answer truthfully. Who knew what, when?

What did officials know? What did the police know? What did politicians know? Extract the information, and if they were found to be complicit/failed to act? Criminal prosecutions must follow, with foreign nationals deported.

There needs to be a forensic analysis of the communities where this mass rape was tolerated - who knew? Who said nothing? What role did sharia courts play? It would simply be impossible for friends/family members to be unaware. Are wives honestly saying that they had no idea of what their husbands were doing, repeatedly over many years?

"Democrats Weaponized FBI To Falsely Claim White Supremacists Posed Greater Terror Threat Than Radical Islamists

There was never any evidence that right-wing political violence was increasing

by @shellenberger 
FBI Director Christopher Wray; New Orleans terrorism suspect, Shamsud-Din Jabbar; President Joe Biden

A 42-year-old former Army IT specialist named Shamsud-Din Jabbar committed an act of terrorism by killing 15 in his truck in New Orleans early on New Year‚Äôs Day, says the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). And there appears to be abundant evidence, including testimony from his close relatives and videos he posted to Facebook, that radical Islamic ideology motivated Jabbar.

Jabbar‚Äôs motivations may come as a surprise to millions of Americans. After all, for the last four years, the FBI, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), President Joe Biden, and other United States agencies that constitute the Intelligence Community (IC) have emphasized that the greatest threat of terrorism comes from white supremacists, not radicalized Islamists.

The ‚Äútop threat we face from DVEs [Domestic Violent Extremist] continues to be those we identify as Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists (‚ÄòRMVEs‚Äô), specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the white race,‚Äù FBI Director Christopher Wray told Senate Judiciary Committee on March 2, 2021.

‚ÄúAccording to the intelligence community,‚Äù said Biden in 2021, ‚Äúterrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today. Not ISIS, not al Qaeda ‚Äî white supremacists.‚Äù

As a result, Wray said in 2021 that ""‚Ääracially motivated violent extremism is the biggest chunk of our domestic terrorism portfolio, if you will, overall. I will also say that the same group of people we're talking about have been responsible for the most lethal attacks over the last decade.""

Those arguments have continued over the last four years. In August 2024, the New Yorker reported ‚Äúaround 2018 the F.B.I. began seeing an increase in racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists‚Äîin particular, ‚Äòindividuals espousing the superiority of the white race.‚Äô‚Äù

The evidence never supported any of those claims.
Between 2012 and 2021, Islamic extremists committed five acts of domestic US terrorism that killed 77 people, whereas white supremacists committed four acts of domestic terrorism that killed 49 people. And even if the numbers were reversed, at just 12 cases of domestic terrorism, the sample size is too small to be able to claim, scientifically, any kind of discernible trend about DVE.

The total number of killings by white supremacists annually is very low. In 2022, there were only 21 homicides linked to white supremacists in the entire country. By comparison, Chicago alone saw an average of 58 homicides every month. In 2022, there were a total of 24,849 homicides. Thus, the share of them that were by white supremacists was .08%.

This is not to suggest that the FBI could have prevented the New Orleans attack on New Year‚Äôs had it been more focused on the threat of would-be Islamic terrorists. The FBI was still on the alert for Islamic terrorism, even as it claimed that white supremacists posed a greater threat. And some mass killings are difficult to prevent so long as we live in a relatively free society.

But the fact that some mass killings may be difficult to prevent is no excuse for the FBI to mislead the public, policymakers, and other law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

The FBI‚Äôs claim that white supremacy was the main driver of the acts of terrorism was also misleading. Most of the white supremacist killers appeared to suffer from mental illness, whereas most of the radical Islamicists appeared sane and driven overwhelmingly by ideology. The Wisconsin shooter had a history of alcoholism and depression; the Charleston and Pittsburgh shooters showed signs of paranoia; the El Paso shooter was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, a chronic and serious mental illness that combines the symptoms of schizophrenia, including hallucinations or delusions, with a mood disorder like depression or bipolar disorder; and the Buffalo shooter had been temporarily committed to a mental hospital. The only exceptionto this appears to be the Orlando shooter.

Thus, there was never any good evidence that there was a rising threat of terrorism from the political ideology of white supremacy, nor that it was greater than the threat of Islamist terrorism. And yet FBI Director Wray, President Biden, and the whole of the US IC have claimed, repeatedly, for four years, that it was. Why?

"I'm just going to leave this here:

""Hi Grok!

If you fire a weapon inside a Tesla Cybertruck, from what distance outside of the truck can the gunshot be heard?""

""The audibility of a gunshot from inside a Tesla Cybertruck largely depends on several factors including the type of weapon fired, the surrounding environment, and the structural integrity of the Cybertruck itself. Here's what we can infer from the available information:

Vehicle Design: The Tesla Cybertruck is made with ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel, which is intended to provide durability, including some level of bullet resistance. However, this doesn't necessarily mean it's soundproof. The design might affect how sound travels out of the vehicle due to the materials used and the shape of the truck.

Sound Propagation: Sound from a gunshot inside the Cybertruck would propagate through the vehicle's structure and open air. The stainless steel body might dampen some sound, but not entirely, especially if windows or doors are open or if the sound can escape through other structural paths like vents or seams. 
Environmental Factors: The environment outside the truck plays a significant role. In an open field, sound might travel further than in an urban area with buildings that can block or absorb sound. Weather conditions, like wind direction and ambient noise levels, also influence how far a gunshot can be heard.
Weapon Type: The caliber and type of weapon would impact the loudness of the gunshot. A 9mm handgun, for instance, might produce a less loud sound compared to a higher-caliber rifle or shotgun, which would be louder regardless of the vehicle's material. However, specific tests on the Cybertruck with different weapons (like Tommy Guns, handguns, and rifles) have shown varying levels of penetration but not necessarily soundproofing.

Given these considerations:

Distance of Audibility: Without specific soundproofing tests on the Cybertruck, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact distance. However, as a general guideline, gunshots from handguns can typically be heard up to about 1-2 miles under optimal conditions. For rifles, this can extend to several miles. Inside a vehicle like the Cybertruck, the sound might be slightly muffled but still audible at significant distances, potentially reduced to several hundred yards to half a mile if considering typical suburban environments with some background noise.
Testing Data: There isn't direct data from tests specifically measuring sound propagation from gunshots inside a Cybertruck, but the bullet resistance tests imply that while the truck can handle some gunfire in terms of physical damage, sound would still escape.

Therefore, while the Cybertruck might slightly dampen the sound of a gunshot, it's reasonable to expect that in most scenarios, the gunshot would be audible from several hundred yards to over a mile, depending on the above factors. However, for precise measurements, controlled testing would be necessary.""",2025-01-02 22:25:18+00:00

Germany's economy, once the powerhouse of Europe, is now mired in bureaucracy and stifling regulations. The AfD understands that economic freedom is not just desirable but necessary. Their approach to reducing government overreach, cutting taxes, and deregulating the market echoes the principles that have made Tesla and SpaceX successful. If Germany is to reclaim its industrial might, it needs a party that will not just talk about growth but enact policies to foster an environment where businesses can thrive without the heavy hand of government. 

 Immigration and National Identity:

Germany has opened its borders to mass migration, which, while humanitarian in intent, has led to significant cultural and social tensions. The AfD advocates for a controlled immigration policy that prioritizes integration and the preservation of German culture and security. This is not about xenophobia but about ensuring that Germany does not lose its identity in the quest for globalism. A nation must maintain its core values and cultural heritage to remain strong and united. 

Energy and Independence:

The energy policies pushed by current coalitions are not only economically costly but also geopolitically naive. Germany's decision to phase out nuclear power and rely heavily on coal and imported gas, plus highly variable wind and solar without the necessary grid-scale batteries to provide stability, has left it vulnerable, especially in light of energy supply disruptions. The AfD's stance on energy is pragmatic, advocating for a balanced approach. I hope they consider doubling down on safe nuclear power, together with battery energy storage to buffer large swings in electricity usage, as that is the obvious solution. 

Political Realism:

The traditional parties have failed Germany. Their policies have led to economic stagnation, social unrest, and a dilution of national identity. The AfD, despite being labeled far-right, offers a political realism that resonates with many Germans who feel their concerns are ignored by the establishment. They address the issues at hand without the political correctness that often masks the truth. 

The description of AfD as far-right is made obviously false simply by noting that Alice Weidel, the party leader has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please. 

 Innovation and the Future:

I've built companies on the principle that innovation requires freedom from unnecessary constraints. The AfD's vision aligns with this ethos. They push for educational reforms that encourage critical thinking over indoctrination and support tech industries which are the future of global economic leadership. 

To those who decry the AfD as extremist, I say, look beyond the labels. Look at the policies, the economic plans, and the cultural preservation efforts. Germany needs a party that isn't afraid to challenge the status quo, that isn't bogged down by the politics of the past.

The AfD can save Germany from becoming a shadow of its former self. It can steer the country towards a future where economic prosperity, cultural integrity, and technological innovation are not just aspirations but realities. Germany has been too comfortable with mediocrity; it's time for bold changes, and the AfD is the only party offering that path.

"Elon Musk‚Äôs opinion article in Die Welt explaining his support for the AfD has sparked widespread debate. I see a lot of speculation on how this piece came about so let me explain.

As a friend of Elon and a Supervisory Board Member of Axel Springer, I saw his public support for the AfD on X as an opportunity for him to elaborate on his views in a more thoughtful and detailed way. I reached out to Jennifer Wilton, the editor-in-chief of Die Welt, to gauge her interest in an editorial from Elon on the subject. After careful consideration, she agreed that such a piece would be of significant news value and worthy of publication. I then approached Elon, explaining the potential impact of this opportunity to clarify his position. He liked the idea, wrote the article, and Die Welt published it.",2025-01-01 18:53:56+00:00
"Dear @elonmusk,

The way to free Tommy Robinson is through legal action. While he‚Äôs in prison he‚Äôs asked me to help with two urgent battles. Permit me to describe them for you, and all your followers:

1. Tommy was sentenced to 18 months in prison for publishing that documentary you just retweeted. The judge specifically referred to Twitter/X, and the video‚Äôs wide distribution when giving out the sentence. Tommy will likely be released in 9 months, but in the meantime he is being held in segregation (solitary confinement). No man can do nine months of solitary without major mental health damage ‚Äî it‚Äôs a form of torture, like what was done to Julian Assange.

Remember, contempt of court in this case is a civil offence ‚Äî not a crime. It‚Äôs outrageous and unprecedented that he be held in solitary, which is usually reserved for short-term punishments of violent prisoners who misbehave in prison. 

We have hired a lawyer who is an expert in prison law to challenge the way he is being held. We just received the reply from the prison governor, refusing to move Tommy from solitary, saying that he must stay there because of ‚Äúthe polarising nature of his ideology‚Äù. You can see that letter here: https://t.co/fuoU1eBIjs

We are moving quickly to appeal that prison governor‚Äôs decision in a judicial review. 

2. While Tommy is in prison, he is being charged with a bogus, trumped up charge under the Terrorism Act ‚Äî a UK version of the Patriot Act. Obviously Tommy is not a terrorist (and police told him as much when they arrested him). They‚Äôre just using that extreme law to subject Tommy to questioning that he legally cannot refuse under the act and to search his phone without a warrant, as is also permitted in the act. Tommy refused to give police the password to his cell phone without a warrant (he had both legal and journalistic confidences in it), so they‚Äôre prosecuting him for that, too. 

For each of these two battles we need both a solicitor and a barrister (they‚Äôre different people in the UK). So we‚Äôre crowdfunding FOUR different lawyers. Frankly, we need help. 

Tommy has been debanked and deplatformed, so Tommy asked me and Rebel News to crowdfund his lawyers for him, which were doing at https://t.co/9znjumweQf

They really are throwing the unlimited resources of the state against him. Not for a crime, but for a political and journalistic disagreement.

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be able to change the mind of Keir Starmer, the authoritarian Prime Minister who used to be the UK‚Äôs chief prosecutor. But if you could help direct attention towards our legal crowdfund, I think we have a reasonable chance to get him into a more sensible prison for the rest of his sentence, and to swat down this bogus Terrorism Act charge.

Thanks!

"Hello @ElonMusk and Friends, 

You asked who is funding and organizing the #TeslaTakedown protests. I've got answers for you, after going onto the streets of northern Virginia for the local protests here, seeing familiar faces from the Virginia Democratic political machine and then following the money -- and the data.

AstroTurf Protest Industry
To your question, at latest count, as of 3/30, 5:30 AM:
üî¥24 organizations and counting are funding and organizing the #TeslaTakedown protests and leading the very partisan propaganda campaign against Tesla, Tesla drivers, Tesla employees, Donald Trump and you. See below to see all 24 groups with their revenues, involvement, tax ID numbers and other info.
üî¥These organizations have combined annual revenues of at least $124 MILLION and counting.
üî¥ 100% of the groups are aligned with the Democratic Party. At the protest on 3/29 at Tyco Road, in Tysons, Va., a photo I took of a ""Virginia Democrats"" sign in front of the Tesla dealership.
üî¥ Most of these groups enjoy tax-deductible status as 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) organizations, claiming they are ""nonpartisan."" A few have PACs. The organizations have not returned requests for comment.

Database
üî¥ You can see the raw data on 306 #TeslaTakedown protests in the database here: https://t.co/TR3r36MtSJ

Back story
I'm a former Wall Street Journal reporter and a propaganda expert and editor of the @DPearlProject, a journalism nonprofit named for my WSJ colleague and friend Daniel Pearl. Since Oct. 7th, I have been reporting on the anti-Jew, anti-America, anti-Israel protests and building a database, following the money. It numbers 2,000 groups now, and I am working on a web and mobile app for parents, policymakers, university administrators, law enforcement, the public and others.

I went to the #TeslaTakedown protest a week ago Saturday on Tyco Road at the Tysons, Va., and saw familiar faces from Indivisible and the Fairfax County Democratic Party, shouting for you to be deported as they stood outside the Tesla dealership. I wondered too who is organizing and funding the protests nationwide. 

I got the protest details scraped from ActionNetwork and Mobilize, the two platforms aligned with the Democratic Party promoting the #TeslaTakedown protests, and built a public database of the groups behind the Tesla protest.

AstroTurf, not ""grassroots""
üî¥ In an article for the @FairfaxTimes, I wrote about how the local protests in Tysons, are a window into how the protests are AstroTurf, not ""grassroots."" What this case reveals is the way that a multi-million dollar professional protest industry manufactures outrage in top-down political theater, agitprop, or agitation propaganda, and now criminal offenses. Here is the article: https://t.co/8n7lP8hMF4

üî¥ Next step: I just got data on the April 5 #HandsOff protests and will be adding that data to the database. In addition, I am completing an analysis of the propaganda using the tools of natural language processing and content analysis. 

Why is this important to report on? Because defending principles of free enterprise and individual liberty in the U.S. means allowing people to buy whatever make of car they wish without fear of danger or harassment and allowing companies to do business without fear of danger or harassment.

All, please let me know if you have any questions, ideas or recommendations.

"This may be a little snarky, but it's important, so here goes:

Northern Wisconsin lost Republican representation when we lost the Supreme Court in the last election where Janet Protosiewicz beat Dan Kelly. It's so hard to express the importance of the Supreme Court election, particularly after a presidential election. We are fatigued. People have better things to do than to talk about politics every day. Some of us are struggling with everything from paying our bills to cancer diagnoses. I get it. We can't care about politics every moment of every day, and you don't have to. It only takes five minutes to go to your local polling station, vote, and carry on with your day.

Let me tell you what's at stake here. In comparison with the last Supreme Court election, we are at risk of having our districts redrawn, in the same fashion as they did to get rid of me in Northern Wisconsin, successfully, I might add. The papers were already drawn up before the election was over- it was a political bloodbath. With that single election, we lost numerous Republican representatives. Not only that, but it was full-blown political cannibalism, with John Spiros and Donna Mummau Rozar running against each other. Nate Gustafson running against Michael Schraa. People that had been on the same team were now enemies in a game of political musical chairs. In the end, no matter the outcome, we lost two great representatives, and those were the reps that went head-to-head. In my position, there was no reason to run. The governor and the new left-leaning Wisconsin Supreme Court had made my seat unwinnable, cheating the Northern Republicans out of fair representation.

Although that was a big deal in the assembly, this race is even more important. If Susan Crawford wins this election, they already have the paperwork drawn up to steal two congressional districts from us. If we lose this election, we lose those seats. If we lose those seats, we will lose the house at the federal level. It will make it nearly impossible for our president Donald J. Trump to continue to do his job when we put a stick in the spokes with a left-leaning house.

There is upwards of 80 million dollars being spent on this election. The most recent event was in Eau Claire this week. Eau Claire is NOT NORTHERN WISCONSIN. The campaign should be focused on red districts and red counties like Burnett, Washburn, Sawyer, Price, Polk, Rusk, Oneida, Lincoln; instead, the money is being spent in Milwaukee. In my opinion, that is a grave mistake.

I implore you to stop by your local polling location and cast a vote for Brad Schimel for Wisconsin Supreme Court. This election, which is projected to have low-turnout compared to the presidential election, will change the trajectory of the entire country.  I have said this the entire campaign- Northern Wisconsin Will Decide This Election!

"Poverty is the underlying cause of homelessness, say the mainstream media. But it's not. Poverty has declined steadily for decades as homelessness got worse. And people priced out of their housing for reasons unrelated to addiction or untreated mental illness find another place to live. They don't pitch a tent on the dirtiest and most dangerous sidewalks in America. 

The reason the problem grew so much worse is that a handful of well-financed ideological activists persuaded cities and states to incentivize homelessness through unconditional cash payments, promises of unconditional free housing, and the decriminalization of shoplifting and open-air drug dealing. 

Last week I released a short video on how progressive West Coast cities made homelessness worse. Now, I'm happy to release this hour-long video that goes through the evidence about the nature of the problem and how to solve it in great detail.",2024-04-29 19:22:34+00:00

"The Dirty Little Secret About Homelessness Is Also The Key To Ending It

The US Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments about what cities can and cannot do to end homelessness.

""What if there is a bed available in the Gospel Rescue Mission, but Ms. Johnson, a person, doesn't want it? Doesn‚Äôt wish to leave their pet. Her Rottweiler's not permitted there. So that is a difficult question for a person and a difficult policy question...""

What everyone agreed on was that homelessness is a difficult problem.

""Many people have mentioned this is a serious policy problem‚Ä¶ So,  the policy questions in this case are very difficult‚Ä¶.Martin speaks in terms of someone who is involuntarily homeless and that raises all of those policy questions‚Ä¶ We usually think about whether state law, local law already achieves those purposes so that the federal courts aren't micromanaging homeless policy‚Ä¶""

I think most people listening to the Supreme Court would agree: it isn‚Äôt going to solve homelessness. That is a job for state legislators. So why haven‚Äôt they? Why has homelessness gotten worse?

The answer that many homeless advocates give is that it‚Äôs because we don‚Äôt have enough homes, and poverty has increased. But neither is true. Poverty has steadily declined since the 1980s, when homelessness first became an issue of public concern.

And very few people are on the street simply because they can‚Äôt afford the rent.

The evidence is overwhelming that the majority of people on the street are there because of untreated mental illness or addiction, which leads people to use all their money to support their drug habit and be high, rather than work.

People who can‚Äôt afford the rent but are able to work and aren‚Äôt in the grip of addiction or untreated mental illness find a cheaper place to live, move somewhere cheaper, or live with family and friends.

It‚Äôs true there aren‚Äôt enough shelter beds, case workers, group homes, and psychiatric hospitals to care for the homeless.

But a big part of the reason for that is that advocates for the homeless have, for 40 years, demanded that funding for dealing with the homeless go into giving people private studio apartments rather than building sufficient shelter beds.

They call this ‚ÄúHousing First,‚Äù and its record is awful. Few stay in housing, and many die because it fails to treat the cause of the problem, addiction, and untreated mental illness rather than the symptoms.

Studies find that cities that prioritize basic shelter over expensive housing reduce the deaths of homeless by 3-fold. And so in LA, homeless die at a rate 3 times higher than New York because living inside protects people from murder, drug overdose, and car accidents.

Making matters worse, homeless advocates, along with the ACLU, have opposed expanding psychiatric hospitals, and mandatory care in general, because they believe it‚Äôs worse to mandate hospitalization for people who are dangerously psychotic or manic than to simply leave them on the street.

But it‚Äôs not. Last year, 112,000 Americans died from drug overdose and poisoning because we failed to mandate treatment. Two of my friends from high school would still be alive today had we mandated they get treatment for addiction rather than letting them die.

What is happening on homelessness is a record of failure. The number of drug deaths quintupled from 20,000 in 2022 to 112,000 last year. That‚Äôs more people dying per year than died in Hiroshima.

Homelessness is not a fundamental problem of housing. It‚Äôs a problem of enabling addiction and untreated mental illness, both of which lead people to give up on work, lie, steal, cheat their families and friends, and live on the street, where they turn to petty crime to sustain their drug habits.

This seems cruel to many people, which is why homelessness has gotten worse. In other words, the reason homelessness has gotten worse is because we‚Äôve enabled it, and subsidized it, rather than funded treatment and recovery. Nobody has subsidized homelessness more than California, Washington, and Oregon. And it‚Äôs been in those states that homelessness has worsened the most.

Why? The homelessness groups really believe it‚Äôs more cruel to mandate care than to let people die on the streets.

But there is an ideology behind this, too. It‚Äôs the idea that people suffering from addiction and mental illness are victims of society or the system, which is fundamentally evil. And, according to their logic, to restore justice in the world, we must give victims whatever they want, including the right to camp anywhere and use hard drugs, even if it results in their death.

You might call this ""pathological altruism. Think of the Kathy Bates character in Misery. Or of the mother who poisons her child in order to have a sick person to take care of, like in ‚ÄúSixth Sense.‚Äù

It‚Äôs no coincidence that the same people who believe this also think civilization is evil and should be replaced by something more akin to primitive anarchism, like the kind romanticized by intellectuals since Rousseau.

The alternative to this dystopia is tough love. We need to give people the care they need, but that‚Äôs not through enabling addiction and illegal behavior, but rather enforcing laws and mandating care, as an alternative to jail, when they are broken.

It‚Äôs not enough to do what many Republicans want to do, which is to enforce laws and recriminalize shoplifting and hard drugs simply. We need to do that, for sure.

But states must also have caseworkers, group homes, and psychiatric hospitals so there is an alternative to jail, and so states can provide people with the specialized care where it‚Äôs available, which simply isn‚Äôt going to be in many of the small towns, like the one at the center of the Supreme Court hearing.

"Brazilian Judge Pushes Nationalist Conspiracy Theory To Weaponize Federal Police Against Defenders Of Free Speech

Brazil‚Äôs Federal Police discuss me in new report commissioned by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes

Yesterday, a Brazilian Supreme Court Justice, who is also the President of the Superior Electoral Commission, lashed out angrily at X owner Elon Musk. At an event heavily promoted by Globo News, Alexandre de Moraes claimed that Musk is part of a vast extremist conspiracy to undermine Brazil‚Äôs sovereignty and democracy. He claimed that Musk was an ‚Äúirresponsible mercantilist‚Äù motivated solely by profits who had ‚Äúunited‚Äù with ‚Äúextremist Brazilian politicians.‚Äù

But there is no evidence of any conspiracy. Musk did not know I would publish the Twitter Files Brazil. Nor did the Brazilian politicians who reacted to them. And many of the politicians and journalists who de Moraes is demonizing as ‚Äúextremist‚Äù are advocates of freedom of speech, including the right to criticize de Moraes.

It‚Äôs true that some of the people who de Moraes is censoring have urged a military intervention and have made unsubstantiated claims about elections and Covid. I do not agree with many of the statements made by the people whom de Moraes has censored.

But freedom of speech means nothing if it does not protect people and ideas you disagree with. If we aren‚Äôt going to allow people to criticize democracy, elections, and vaccines, how will we ever know if they are bad? If people are spreading false information about democracy, elections, and vaccines, the best way to deal with the false information is with accurate information, not censorship.

The real extremist spreading disinformation here is de Moraes. If Musk were solely motivated by money, then he would not have stood up to de Moraes, which resulted in the Brazilian government halting all advertising on X, the resignation of X‚Äôs top lawyer in Brazil, who feared for his safety, and may result in de Moraes shutting down X in Brazil.

He is not simply demanding that social media platforms censor specific content by controversial journalists and politicians. He is demanding that all social media platforms ban them for life. He often does so through secret hearings without the right of appeal.

In fact, it‚Äôs all much worse than that. You can‚Äôt be a politician or journalist if you can‚Äôt communicate on social media. And so de Moraes is not just violating the Brazilian constitution‚Äôs protections of free speech, he is also attacking the freedom of the press, destroying careers, and interfering in elections.

De Moraes has acted unilaterally to invent entirely new laws. He is thus interfering and taking over the role of Congress and of the president. That means he is behaving like a dictator.

And now de Moraes has weaponized the Federal Police, including against me, for publishing the Twitter Files in Brazil. The Federal Police delivered two reports to de Moraes, one on April 18 and the other on April 19. The reports consist of a gigantic conspiracy theory, suggesting connections and relationships that simply do not exist.

The reports single me out and suggest it is somehow suspicious that I only have paid for one subscription on X, which is to Elon Musk. But there is nothing suspicious about this. I am paying Musk, not the other way around. And, as the Police report notes, Musk takes a percentage of the revenue of the people who subscribe to my content on X.

And the reports claim that people who de Moraes had demanded be censored had gained limited access to communicate on X, in particular through X‚Äôs Spaces, which allows for live conversation.

In other words, de Moraes is totally obsessed with silencing his enemies. It‚Äôs not enough for X to have blocked profiles. He also doesn‚Äôt want them to be able to use their voice.

It helps that the Brazilian government directly pays the Brazilian news media. The new Lula government increased government funding by 60% for Globo alone. Globo is the biggest media in Brazil. It has been demanding more censorship and running propaganda for de Moraes.

De Moraes is a brutish authoritarian. His censorship is as bad as the censorship imposed by Brazil‚Äôs military dictators. He is seeking, as a judge, to eliminate particularly politicians and journalists from public life.

This is hardly the first time de Moraes has weaponized the Federal Police. And in calling Elon Musk a foreign mercantilist, de Moraes is using the exact same kind of nationalist rhetoric that he has attacked his enemies for using.

Why does Moraes have so much power? In Brazil, people told me it was because de Moraes controls so many court cases involving rich and powerful people, including politicians and other judges.

The solution is for Brazil‚Äôs Congress to open an investigation, known as a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry (CPI). A CPI can evaluate judicial abuses of power, and that is obviously what is happening here. Under a CPI, Brazil‚Äôs Congress could gain access to communications between police and judges or anyone else. 

A CPI could also hear from the victims of censorship. It could bring light to thousands of cases under secrecy. And it could discover how social media platforms were compelled to obey or collaborate with the regime.

Musk has taken extraordinary and historic actions to protect free speech. So, too has the US Congress. Now it‚Äôs time for Brazil‚Äôs Congress to act against the anti-democratic extremism of de Moraes. It must do so before the extremist de Moraes starts arresting his political enemies and shuts down X, and thus free speech, in Brazil.",2024-04-20 17:14:53+00:00

"Years Of US-UK Military And Intelligence Planning Behind Sweeping Brazil Censorship, Evidence Suggests

_Secret evidence, specialized spy units, and permanent bans on populists were key tactics developed by government operatives_

Late last night, the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives released over 500 pages of confidential Brazilian court documents relating to censorship demands on X, formerly Twitter. The Committee had obtained them from X through its subpoena powers.

The documents show a single Superior Electoral Court (TSE) Justice, Alexandre de Moraes, demanding permanent bans on over 150 elected officials and journalists. De Moraes demanded these bans in secret processes, without explanation or means of appeal, and across social media platforms. Given the dependence of elected leaders on social media, these demands for bans may constitute electoral interference.
In one case, De Moraes demanded that all major social media platforms, including at least one, Twitter, which did not publish the offending material, ban a federal Congressman, Marcel Van Hattem. The TSE had claimed that Van Hattem had criticized the election results. Not only had Van Hattan‚Äôs video not been related to the elections, but it was also a criticism of the Labor Department. It was released one day before the election.

In many ways, Brazil‚Äôs sweeping censorship system is unique to Brazil. Brazil‚Äôs Censorship Industrial Complex is located in the judiciary rather than in the executive branch, as it is in Europe, in the European Commission, and the U.S., in the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, National Science Foundation, and other agencies.

However, in other ways, Brazil‚Äôs censorship simply reflects the most advanced form of the Censorship Industrial Complex vision created by US and UK government officials, particularly ones working for the military and intelligence agencies.
Our work revealed that current and former agents from the US Department of Defense, the CIA, the Department of Homeland Security, and the British Ministry of Defense all developed comprehensive censorship programs. The Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation have been caught funding the creation of censorship tools, including AI-based ones, for Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms to engage in mass censorship.

That‚Äôs it. This new flow enables you to create and launch effective campaigns in just a few minutes.

Our AI-powered Optimized Targeting feature is activated by default for Sales campaigns. This allows X‚Äôs algorithms to reach people beyond your targeted audience when there‚Äôs potential to achieve better ROI. In beta testing, we observed an average increase of 10% in click-through rates and an average increase of 16% in conversion rates. Consequently, 92% of advertisers are seeing improved results and have chosen to keep Optimized Targeting enabled.

We‚Äôve also introduced a new cost estimate feature which provides a projected range of what your CPM (cost per 1k impressions) may be for Sales campaigns. This helps you to make informed decisions to reach your campaign goals. The values displayed are estimates only; the actual CPM of your campaign may vary.

X‚Äôs algorithms and AI capabilities grow more powerful each day, enhancing the relevance of your ads and boosting your ROI. Launch a Sales campaign on X today to drive purchases and grow your business.",2024-04-18 22:28:39+00:00

"üö®üáßüá∑ THE BRAZIL X FILES: BRAZIL'S SUPREME COURT GRANTED ITSELF UNPRECEDENTED POWERS

In 2019, Brazil‚Äôs Supreme Court assumed extraordinary powers to initiate investigations independently, acting as investigator, prosecutor, and judge. 

This decision was so controversial that even former justices criticized it as being unprecedented and flat-out unconstitutional. 

Justice de Moraes was appointed to conduct the court's first self-initiated investigation and has since used this authority to target critics across the political spectrum, often bypassing traditional legal processes.

Moraes, who also presides over the Superior Electoral Court, has been particularly aggressive in censoring alleged ""misinformation"" about elections, leading to actions such as social media bans and even federal raids without clear justification. 

Leveraging these new powers, he conducted raids on the homes of ten social media users who criticized the court and notably, in July 2019, targeted eight businessmen‚Äîfreezing their bank accounts and suspending their social media profiles.

"Today @MoniquePintarel, Head of the America's at X, addressed the¬†@MMApress's Board of Global Advertisers regarding the recent situation with @doubleverify and @X. In the spirit of transparency, please find her remarks below.

Remarks:
Hi everyone, I am not sure if you are all aware of the recent news surrounding X & Doubleverify, so I wanted to take a few minutes to share the latest with all of you.

Since October, DoubleVerify has been mis-reporting the Brand Safety scores of X.

We know this is important information for this group in particular, given the historical commitment to sound measurement and transparency across the marketing & advertising ecosystem.

Before I share the full scope of details, I want to point out that we have been hard at work ensuring we have the controls needed across the platform to ensure safety for our users and our customers.

After listening closely to the marketplace, we have built sensitivity settings, keyword adjacencies and have developed partnerships with both IAS & DoubleVerify to allow for¬† 3rd party verification.

I also want to point out that none of these capabilities were available prior to acquisition.

Now for some details on the current situation.

As mentioned, unfortunately, our team has uncovered a serious issue in the way DoubleVerify was reporting on our Safety scores¬†over¬† the last almost 5 months.

This is an error in their systems that impacted ONLY X.

After digging in with the DV team, I am happy to share that the good news is, we have consistently delivered a safety score of 99.99%, which is above global industry standards and in alignment with safety scores measured by IAS.

DV has accepted responsibility and their CEO has issued a public apology. Additionally, our CEO, Linda Yaccarino has shared detailed comms on the subject.

We are working closely with DV on the matter, and the situation remains fluid. Unfortunately Holding Companies, and maybe some of you in the room, made investment decisions based on this flawed data.

Our ask¬†-- please connect with your agencies & measurement partners to ensure you have the most accurate information.

We are proud of the work we are doing, to ensure our customers¬† have the tools needed¬† to ensure brand safety across our platform. We are now at or above industry standards, in all metrics and capabilities.

The other good news to share is that we have so much innovation and momentum across the company. As we continue to build The Everything App, we are seeing hundreds of brands reactivating and increasing their investment.

We know safety is important to all of you, and it is at the core of all that we are doing at X and we are really excited to get back to business with all of you.",2024-04-15 15:37:13+00:00

"X‚Äôs Brand Safety Rate exceeds 99% according to third-party analysis from DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science.

DoubleVerify, a company responsible for providing Brand Safety measurements to major advertisers, has been displaying an erroneous graphical error of X's Brand Safety Rate on their user interface dashboard for over four and a half months from October 24, 2023 to March 14, 2024.¬†

As a result, the dashboard displayed an extremely misleading lower Brand Safety Rate, in stark contrast to X‚Äôs actual score exceeding 99.99% from October 2023 to present day.

"My Crazy True Story

On April 1st, Tesla unlocked Full Self-Driving capability for all Tesla vehicles in America. In a moment of dire need, at 2:00 am the following morning, I found myself grappling with severe dehydration and a blood glucose level of 670 due to a malfunction in my insulin pump. With no time to spare, I turned to my Model Y for assistance. Engaging the new Full Self-Driving feature with a simple double click on the steering column stalk, I was astounded by the results. Without any intervention, the car skillfully navigated the 13-mile journey from my home to the VA Emergency Room, offering to autonomously park it upon arrival and let me seek immediate medical attention. Despite enduring a mild heart attack, I left the hospital with no restrictions on my exercise regimen, a testament to the swift and efficient response facilitated by the vehicle and the # 1 VA in America. As an owner of luxury vehicles including Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Acura, and Cadillac, I can unequivocally declare Tesla the pinnacle of automotive innovation today. Its lifesaving capabilities in critical moments underscore its superiority. The leap from traditional vehicles to Tesla's Full Self-Driving functionality is like upgrading from a basic phone to a smartphone. As a resident of a solar-powered home, the cost of energy for the last 7000 miles has been minimal, I've saved nearly $1000. I extend my gratitude to Elon Musk for his crazy erratic leadership in advancing technology that is more than just transportation. As someone who shares Elon's place ""on the spectrum"", I am particularly appreciative of his commitment to excellence and innovation. He has profoundly impacted our world and personally impacted my own. Thanks, Tesla, and thanks, Charles George VA Medical Center team!",2024-04-10 04:38:07+00:00
".@ggreenwald highlights @elonmusk's opposition to Brazil's authoritarian censorship regime.

The censorship framework in Brazil mirrors tactics employed by the US government to suppress dissenting voices under the guise of combating disinformation.

""Any criticism of this judge that offends him will result in punishment, no trial, no due process, and that's what they've done now to Elon Musk.""

""This censorship regime has no basis in law. They actually tried to pass a law several months ago that would democratically enact this censorship regime to formally define the powers and the responsibilities of big tech. But they could not get the votes in Congress to pass it.""

Thus, Judge Alexandre de Moraes was given unilateral authority to dictate permissible online speech.

""When they issue these orders to these platforms, they say, we want this member of Congress banned, we want this journalist banned, we want this activist banned. They provide no due process. They provide no explanation. And these orders are never sent to the individuals who are being censored.""

""There is no judicial process for contesting the order. If you do try to contest it, you go right to the judge who issued it, and obviously, you have no chance of being heard.""

""It's not just censorship. It's censorship with no due process in the most Kafkaesque way; there's not even a legal framework for it.""

""They're not even allowed to inform their users that they received a judicial order. Let alone disclose to the public or their users what the content of the order is. They just have to obey and ban the individuals named in the order, and if they don't do so within two hours of receipt, they will face daily fines of $20,000 for every account they fail to ban.""

In January 2023, Greenwald obtained one of these judicial orders that revealed arbitrary bans on democratically elected congress members of the House and Senate, including 25-year-old politician Nikolas Ferreira, who garnered record-breaking support.

Ferreira not only secured a historic victory by amassing the largest vote total of any congressional candidate in Brazil's history but also garnered over a million votes in his state, surpassing all other candidates in the 2022 election. 

However, despite his widespread support, the judge overseeing the censorship regime arbitrarily banned Ferreira from all online platforms, silenced him, and deprived him of his online presence without any explanation or opportunity for due process.

Senators, journalists, and activists who express dissenting opinions or criticize this censorship are similarly targeted for censorship by the same judge, highlighting the authoritarian nature of these actions.

""Needless to say, Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which is by far the most popular chat platform in Brazil, have always just meekly complied with every censorship order they got from Brazil, but Elon Musk decided he had enough.""",2024-04-11 15:19:58+00:00

We call on the court to lift the secrecy orders without delay, to hear our appeals, and for the other branches of the Republic to make every effort, within their respective jurisdictions, to demand the transparency essential in a thriving democracy.

Elon, you are currently aiding Brazil more than many members of the Brazilian House and Senate. You are representing millions of Brazilians who oppose censorship and tyranny far better than their elected representatives, who still refuse to investigate and impeach Supreme Court justices.

I am confident that this will change now: @shellenberger's collaboration with @david_agape_ and @EliVieiraJr on the Brazilian Twitter Files, in a genuine investigative journalism effort, exposed the Brazilian dictator @alexandre de Moraes to the world. 

By the way, I am one of the countless Brazilians featured in the files for being illegally monitored by the Supreme Court. I was also censored without due process and threatened with a hefty fine per day if I posted anything the Court disapproved of - but I never remained silent. In the case of Twitter, the former legal counsel Rafael Batista's refusal to provide Moraes with user information without valid grounds, even under the threat of illegal prosecution and persecution, was heroic. 

Your determination, @elonmusk, to commend that stance and go further by lifting all restrictions on the accounts of Brazilians who were illegally censored shows a man of principles and provides us all with inspiration and renewed motivation to fight the tyrants. 

There are currently thousands of Brazilians persecuted by Moraes: ordinary citizens censored, with their assets illegally frozen; journalists and judges exiled, with their passports seized by Mr. Moraes without justification; lawyers denied access to their clients' cases; hundreds still imprisoned without due process, let alone conviction.

One man, Clez√£o, passed away last November in prison after nearly a year of incarceration in deplorable health conditions by order of Alexandre de Moraes. The federal prosecutor had requested his release more than two months before his death, but Moraes ignored it. Clez√£o's wife, Jane, and their two daughters, Ana Luiza (22) and Klezia (19), will no longer have their father's company due to the tyrannical actions of Alexandre de Moraes.

We want none of this, no more! This is why I proposed a parliamentary committee to investigate the Court's abuses, including censorship. 

The request garnered the support of the necessary 171 representatives and is now awaiting the Speaker of the House, Arthur Lira, to initiate its activities. The Brazil Twitter Files have given new momentum to this endeavor. We cannot rely on most legacy media or the establishment. 

But we can rely on principled individuals like you, @elonmusk and @shellenberger. You may not be Brazilian, but you are fighting for freedom in our country in a way that inspires millions in my homeland to raise their voices and fight even harder to overcome this dire situation.

And we WILL overcome it. Thank you!

"Elon Musk Is All That Stands In The Way Of Totalitarianism

Last night, around 8 p.m. local time in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, Federal Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes announced a criminal investigation into Elon Musk, the owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, for allegedly spreading disinformation, obstructing justice, and allowing people who De Moraes had banned from social media to freely express their views. De Moraes said he would fine X twenty thousand dollars per day for every banned person Musk allows to speak.

As such, De Moraes has taken Brazil one step closer to being a dictatorship. What‚Äôs more, the events of the last few weeks make clear that Elon Musk is the only thing standing in the way of global totalitarianism. Without free speech, there can be no democracy.

If X goes down, we must continue to fight. We can continue to communicate through email and other social media platforms, such as Facebook.

But email is no substitute for social media platforms' capacity to share information with millions of people. Mark Zuckerberg, the owner of Facebook, abandoned his principled free speech position in 2020 after three years of relentless pressure from activist NGOs, Democrats, and corporate advertisers. Today, Facebook actively represses the spread of news.

The mainstream corporate news media have never been more corrupt and totalitarian. With few exceptions, they spread government propaganda as a matter of policy. Nobody demands censorship more than the corporate media, which benefit from governments shutting down their competitors.

Governments are either not protecting free speech or actively participating in the war upon it.

Last month, the US Supreme Court held a hearing where justices made clear that they were fine with the US government pressuring social media companies to censor. Last week, the Scottish government implemented a law to crack down on so-called hate speech, including jokes by comedians. In Ireland, the government wants the power to send police into people‚Äôs homes to search computers and phones for hate speech. In Canada, the governing Liberal party wants the power to send people to prison for life for things they‚Äôve said. And the European Union has empowered a tiny group of bureaucrats to decide what is true and false and engage in mass censorship.

All of this is happening at the very same moment that my colleagues and I have revealed that government intelligence organizations are working through NGOs to interfere in elections by spreading disinformation about populist activists and political candidates. In other words, governments are demanding censorship in order to protect their ability to spread disinformation.

Making matters worse, governments are directly financing corporate news media. The current Brazilian government is spending 30 times more than the previous government on media advertising in order to spread its disinformation.

I never in my life thought I would live to see the rise of totalitarianism in Western countries. A powerful minority of educated elites around the world are demanding the censorship, persecution, and incarceration of their political enemies. Naturally, they are doing so in the name of saving democracy. I am shocked and embarrassed that I used to call many of these totalitarians friends and allies. The only explanation is that they are in the grip of mass psychosis after years of media propaganda and government disinformation falsely claiming that populist political movements are undemocratic.

The fact that the future of free speech rests upon the shoulders of a single individual is not something any of us should want. I do not think that this is a responsibility Elon Musk wants. He would be a far richer person had he never bought Twitter. He would also be living a more peaceful life. After Musk bought Twitter, the Biden administration and the Democratic Party declared war on him. Various government agencies filed multiple frivolous lawsuits against Musk and his companies in ways very similar to the war the Brazilian government is waging against X.

What all of this reveals is that, until Musk bought Twitter, we didn‚Äôt really have freedom of expression. The US government felt that it controlled both the corporate news media and social media companies. We saw in the Twitter Files that the FBI orchestrated a disinformation and censorship campaign in order to protect Joe Biden.

Starting with the Cyber Threat Intelligence League, operatives working for the US Department of Defense and the British Ministry of Defense sought to hide their censorship and disinformation efforts as ‚Äúcyber security.‚Äù After that, the US Department of Homeland Security and the Stanford Internet Observatory engaged in a mass censorship effort around the 2020 elections and Covid.

It is today clear that intelligence and security agencies have been working together around the world to gain control over social media platforms in order to discredit, prosecute, and incarcerate populist leaders. The evidence is now overwhelming that the FBI and Secret Service are covering up evidence related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot in Washington DC. And there is still much we do not know about the eerily similar riot in Brazil‚Äôs capitol on January 8, 2023.

There is much we need to do to fight back....",2024-04-08 13:03:42+00:00

"BRAZIL IS ON THE BRINK

I‚Äôm reporting to you from Brazil, where a dramatic series of events are underway.

At 5:52 pm Eastern Time, today, April 6, 2024, X corporation, formerly known as Twitter, announced that a Brazilian court had forced it to ‚Äúblock certain popular accounts in Brazil.‚Äù 

Then, less than one hour later, the owner of X, @ElonMusk announced that X would defy the court‚Äôs order, and lift all restrictions.

‚ÄúAs a result,‚Äù said Musk, ‚Äúwe will probably lose all revenue in Brazil and have to shut down our office there. But principles matter more than profit.‚Äù

At any moment, Brazil‚Äôs Supreme Court could shut off all access to X/Twitter for the people of Brazil.
It is not an exaggeration to say that Brazil is on the brink of dictatorship at the hands of a totalitarian Supreme Court Justice named Alexandre de Moraes.

President Lula da Silva is participating in the push toward totalitarianism. Since taking office, Lula has massively increased government funding of the mainstream news media, most of which are encouraging increased censorship.

What Lula and de Moraes are doing is an outrageous violation of Brazil‚Äôs constitution and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.

At this moment, Brazil is not yet a dictatorship. It still has elections and the Brazilian people have other means at their disposal to confront authoritarianism.

But the Federal Supreme Court and the Superior Electoral Court are directly interfere in those elections through censorship.

Three days ago I published the Twitter Files for Brazil. They show that Moraes has violated the Brazilian Constitution. Moraes illegally demanded that Twitter reveal private information about Twitter users who used hashtags he considered inappropriate. He demanded access to Twitter's internal data, violating the platform's policy. He censored, on his own initiative and without any respect for due process, posts on Twitter by parliamentarians from the Brazilian Congress. And Moraes tried to turn Twitter's content moderation policies into a weapon against supporters of then-president Jair Bolsonaro.

I say this as an independent and non-partisan journalist. I'm not a fan of either Bolsonaro or Trump. My political views are very moderate. But I know censorship when I see it.

The Twitter Files also revealed that Google, Facebook, Uber, WhatsApp and Instagram betrayed the people of Brazil. If such evidence is proven, the executives of these companies behaved like cowards: they provided the Brazilian government with personal registration data and telephone numbers without a court order and, therefore, violating the law.
When Twitter refused to provide Brazilian authorities with private user information, including direct messages, the government attempted to sue Twitter's top Brazilian lawyer.

When I lived in Brazil in 1992, I was very left-wing. At the time, Lula and the PT's slogans were ‚ÄúWithout fear of being happy‚Äù.

In recent days, I have spoken to dozens of Brazilians, including professors, journalists and respected lawyers. Everyone tells me they are shocked by what is happening. They told me that they are afraid to speak their mind and that the Lula government is complicit in creating this climate of fear.

Brazil belongs to the Brazilians. It is not my country. As such, there are limits to what I am capable of doing.

But I can say things that many Brazilians do not feel safe saying: Alexandre de Moraes is a tyrant. And the only way to deal with tyrants is to confront them. It is up to Brazil‚Äôs senators to confront the tyrant. And it is up to the people of Brazil to demand that their senators do so.",2024-04-07 00:57:52+00:00
"TWITTER FILES - BRAZIL

Brazil is engaged in a sweeping crackdown on free speech led by a Supreme Court justice named Alexandre de Moraes.

De Moraes has thrown people in jail without trial for things they posted on social media. He has demanded the removal of users from social media platforms. And he has required the censorship of specific posts, without giving users any right of appeal or even the right to see the evidence presented against them.

Now, Twitter Files, released here for the first time, reveal that de Moraes and the Superior Electoral Court he controls engaged in a clear attempt to undermine democracy in Brazil. They:

‚Äî illegally demanded that Twitter reveal personal details about Twitter users who used hashtags he did not like;

‚Äî demanded access to Twitter‚Äôs internal data, in violation of Twitter policy;

‚Äî sought to censor, unilaterally, Twitter posts by sitting members of Brazil‚Äôs Congress;

‚Äî sought to weaponize Twitter‚Äôs content moderation policies against supporters of then-president @jairbolsonaro 

The Files show: the origins of the Brazilian judiciary‚Äôs demand for sweeping censorship powers; the court‚Äôs use of censorship for anti-democratic election interference; and the birth of the Censorship Industrial Complex in Brazil.

I used to think:

There is nothing a teacher or anyone else for that matter could have said to change my sexual orientation or feelings about my gender. I thought, quit making such a big deal out of nothing.

But now I realize:

Either nature, or nurture, blessed me with an unusual mental firewall. Despite a culture of education that encouraged unquestioning acceptance, I maintained my curiosity and stubbornness to seek deep understanding before internalizing any sort of input. 

For every person like me, there are several who are vulnerable or even attracted to manipulators spoon feeding selfish ideologies.

So now what:

When I pair this new understanding with my very strong intuition that freedom of speech is the most important foundational right for a thriving humanity, I become conflicted.

There is not a government or organization on Earth that can be trusted to be the judge of truth. Abuse of this absolute power is guaranteed.

But it is critical that we train future humans with good information. The feedback cycle for generational cultural change is very slow, and incredible damage can take place if we get far enough off of track.

"There have been a few recent articles in the press about @Disney 'winning' its proxy contest with Nelson Peltz based on early election returns that have been leaked to the media.  We don't have an investment in Disney, but I thought it useful to point out the inappropriateness of these leaks to the press.

Only the company and its advisors have access to how shareholders have voted before the day of the annual meeting.  My understanding is that it is illegal to release the outcome of the vote prior to it being finalized as it has the effect of manipulating the outcome.  Here, the company and/or its advisors have leaked that Disney is winning the contest.  It is really inappropriate that they have done so.

And how does one know that it is Disney and/or its advisors that are the source of the leak?

If Peltz were 'winning,' there would be no leaks to the press.

The reason why the progress of an election for directors must be kept confidential until the results are final is that leaking the results can affect the ultimate outcome.  

Institutional shareholders worry about offending management by voting with an activist.  They are concerned that if management learns that they have voted against the incumbent directors, they may lose 'access' to management going forward.  In other words, Bob Iger is less likely to come visit and/or take a call with a shareholder if the shareholder voted with the dissident.

This is clearly a close election.  Institutions don't want to risk voting against the incumbent board if it is clear that the activist will lose.  They want to be on the winning side of the election.  

Here, the company and/or its advisors have leaked the early results in order to tip more institutions and other shareholders to vote for the incumbent board, unfairly tipping the scale in the incumbent board's favor.  In other words, an institution may think: if Peltz is going to lose, it is not worth taking the risk of offending management by voting for him.

This is unfortunately not an uncommon practice.  Years ago, in our proxy contest with ADP, the company and/or its advisors did the same thing.

The @SECGov  should do a thorough investigation of this proxy contest and appropriately punish whoever is responsible for this miscarriage of shareholder governance and justice.

Companies of the caliber of Disney and/or its advisors should not behave this way.

Lastly but importantly, I think highly of Nelson Peltz.  I am sure he would be greatly additive as a member of the Disney board.  Ask yourself, why is the company fighting so hard to keep him off?  The fact that the company leaked the early returns to the media is further evidence that an activist of Nelson's caliber deserves to be on this board for all shareholders benefit.

Based on my knowledge of Nelson's capabilities and the dirty tricks implemented by the company and its advisors, I strongly recommend that shareholders vote for Nelson Peltz for the Disney board.

Institutions who have already voted still have time to change their vote.  It is time that we make an example of Disney here so that this bad practice does not continue to poison shareholder democracy.

"BIDEN CONSIDERING GRANTING AMNESTY, HANDING OUT GREEN CARDS TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS (Daily Caller)

President Joe Biden is currently considering granting amnesty to illegal migrants in a bid to act on the worsening immigration crisis, according to Politico.

Biden and his administration are weighing several ideas to take a tougher stance on the southern border crisis and illegal immigration amid criticisms he has thus far failed to act on either. The administration could start dolling out green cards to illegal immigrants who have long stayed inside the United States, thereby giving them amnesty to stay in the country, three people familiar with the planning¬†told Politico.

"It's All Much Worse Than I Thought

The corporate media are all-in on government censorship

Over the last three years, we have come to learn of the role that our own government officials have played in demanding censorship by social media platforms. Some of this censorship was overt, particularly as it related to COVID. However, some of it was also done in secrecy, as we discovered in the Twitter Files. Many of us thought that once we had uncovered the censorship, governments would be sufficiently embarrassed to stop doing it. And to some extent, that has been the case.

But now, governments around the world are stepping up their efforts to demand more censorship. Last week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation quietly announced it had resumed its outreach to social media companies. Scotland‚Äôs Police could even investigate comedians under a new hate speech law if someone complains about a joke. Major media outlets are currently working with government-funded censorship activists at the University of Washington and Stanford Internet Observatory to demand greater censorship in the name of ‚Äúsaving Democracy.‚Äù

Without a doubt, those of us who have uncovered censorship have had an impact. On ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù last Sunday, the government-funded advocates of censorship at the University of Washington said they have stopped demanding censorship of social media platforms. Simply drawing awareness to who is demanding censorship and who is funding them has weakened their power.

But governments, government-funded NGOs, and the news media have been relentless in their demands for a crackdown on speech they deem hateful and false. At the Supreme Court last week, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson expressed unironic concern that the First Amendment restricts the government‚Äôs ability to censor. And everyone from the New Yorker to the New York Times to NBC is suggesting that the only people who are worried about government censorship are Trump supporters, which is obviously false.

The 60 Minutes segment was particularly shocking. Lesly Stahl never mentioned the mass censorship of accurate information about COVID‚ÄôS origins, COVID vaccines, and lockdowns. She falsely suggested that shining a light on the censorship activists was tantamount to persecution. And she suggested that if the government didn‚Äôt do more to censor misinformation, Trump supporters would overthrow the government, which is a form of disinformation aimed at scaring people into giving up our first and most fundamental freedom.

There are many reasons why they are doing this....",2024-03-26 17:00:17+00:00

"Illegal immigrants can now carry guns, a federal judge has ruled. At this point, it seems like illegals have as many rights as US citizens but without even half the responsibilities.

U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman has ruled that an illegal immigrant's Second Amendment rights were violated when he was charged with unlawfully possessing firearms.

The case in question involves Heriberto Carbajal-Flores, an undocumented immigrant who was charged under 18 U.S.C ¬ß 922, a federal statute prohibiting illegal aliens from carrying guns or ammunition. However, Judge Coleman determined that this law, as applied to Carbajal-Flores, infringes upon his constitutional right to keep and bear arms.

The defense team successfully argued that the government failed to demonstrate how the statute aligns with America's historical tradition of firearm regulation, a requirement set forth by the Supreme Court in 2022. They contended that lifetime disarmament based solely on alienage or nationality lacks roots in U.S. history and tradition.

Remarkably, Judge Coleman noted that Carbajal-Flores has no prior convictions for felonies, violent crimes, or weapons offenses. She even acknowledged his claim that he obtained and used the handgun exclusively for self-protection during a period of documented civil unrest.

The implications of this ruling are profoundly troubling. By extending Second Amendment protections to illegal immigrants, the court has effectively prioritized the rights of non-citizens over the safety and security of American citizens. It sets a dangerous precedent that could lead to a surge in armed illegals , further compromising the US' already strained immigration enforcement efforts.

Moreover, this decision raises serious questions about the consistency and coherence of the legal system. How can anyone justify granting constitutional gun rights to those who have willfully violated immigration laws, while law-abiding citizens face increasing restrictions on their Second Amendment freedoms?

Effectively, the bill creates a new kill switch preventing distribution of prohibited apps or websites at the app store or hosting level. (Sec. 2(a)(1))

(2) What is a ""foreign adversary controlled application"" (or FACA)? First, any website, desktop app, mobile app, or VR app operated by ByteDance or TikTok is a FACA. (Sec. 2(g)(3))

(3) Second, almost ANY social/content-sharing website, desktop app, mobile app, or VR app that has more than 1 million monthly active users can be a FACA if two conditions are met: First, if it is ""controlled by a foreign adversary.""  Second, if the President determines it ""to present a significant threat to the national security of the United States.""  Let's unpack each of these. (Sec. 2(g)(1), 2(g)(2))

(4) The term ‚Äúcontrolled by a foreign adversary‚Äù means that the company (A) is domiciled in, headquartered in, or organized under the laws of a foreign adversary country (i.e. China, Russia, Iran or N. Korea); OR (B) has a 20% ownership group from one of those countries; OR (C) is ""subject to the direction or control of a foreign person or entity"" from one of those countries. (Sec. 2(g)(1))

(5) The last part of that provision has rightly gotten a lot of attention because ""subject to the direction of a foreign person or entity"" is vaguer and broader than merely being ""under the control of"" that person or entity. In theory, if the Attorney General could make a case that a U.S. company was ""subject to the direction of a foreign person or entity"" from China or Russia, then the President could declare it a FACA. The company would then have to fight that determination in federal court.

(6) To make a determination of a national security threat under the Act, the President must issue a public notice and a report to Congress. (Sec. 2(g)(3))

(7) A FACA has 180 days to divest if its owners want to avoid a total ban. The President gets to determine what qualifies as a proper divestiture. (Sec. 2(g)(3), 2(g)(6))

(8) The Attorney General is empowered to investigate potential violations and can pursue enforcement actions in federal district court. The main penalty is a $5,000 per user fine. Thus, for example, Apple could be on the hook for a $500 BILLION fine if all 100 million American TikTok users illegally accessed the app through Apple's platform. The AG may NOT pursue enforcement against an individual user of a FACA. (Sec. 2(d), 2(f))

"Just finished this book - Bad Therapy by @AbigailShrier 

This is one of the most eye-opening books I've ever read. It's a must read for any parent, any teacher, and should be required reading for any school administrator as well.

The book dives into trying to figure out why kids are having so many mental health problems, when there are so many resources devoted to improving mental health outcomes.

Anxiety, depression, suicide, etc are all higher than they've ever been with kids, even though their lives are arguably better than ever before. It just doesn't make sense.

A few key takeaways from the book:

A constant attention on how kids are ""feeling"" or ""thinking"" is causing negative outcomes.

Constantly ruminating on your emotions and how you feel negatively impacts your mental health. If all you do is focus on your emotions, you are destined to be anxious or depressed.

We incessantly ask kids how they're feeling, if they're happy, how their mental health is, etc, and this is creating kids who think they're fragile instead of resilient.

Trying to solve every problem for kids has caused a generation who can't do anything for themselves.

We (Gen X) were told to ""suck it up"" or ""you'll live"" or ""rub some dirt on it"" all the time. Many of us came to the conclusion this is ""bad parenting"" because our feelings were neglected, and we vowed not to do this to our own children.

Because of that, kids immediately over-dramatize everything that happens to them, making mountains out of molehills, and thinking the world must revolve around their emotions and feelings.

You develop confidence and strong mental health by doing things, not by thinking or via therapy.

You can't think your way out of anxiety. You don't gain confidence by analysis of your thoughts or mental health issues. 

You gain confidence and eliminate anxiety by doing gradually more difficult tasks, excelling at them, and realizing you are a competent, capable person. 

The non-stop attention therapy gives to these small, common emotions we all feel blows them out of proportion to their seriousness (not talking about genuine disorders here, just normal anxieties that millions of people go to therapy to try to avoid).

One of the best ways to decrease your happiness is to chase it.

Our society constantly tells kids they should be ""happy"" and asks them if they are.

Happiness isn't a state you should be in 24/7. That's not realistic. Joy and bliss aren't permanent states - they are fleeting.

Contentment, stillness, and being even-keeled are much better goals to aim for mentally.

The happiest, most well adjusted kids come from families with loving parents that have strict rules for the household.

This one really set off the confirmation bias in me... I feel really blessed we have 2 well adjusted middle school kids who do great in school, are very respectful and well mannered, and we barely even need to parent them.

But for years, we were very strict with them. Bedtimes, family rules, how we do things, etc. The in-laws and lots of friends thought we were totalitarian. 

In reality, we just had high standards. And it's really paying off right now. I found it really interesting that strict rules equals happy kids. Makes sense, though, as kids need to know what their boundaries are.

Constantly surveying school-age kids about their mental health causes more issues than it solves.

Mental health resources is big money. Districts need to validate all the resources allocated towards mental health, and they often do that via surveys.

Asking kids non-stop questions like:

- Have you thought about self harm?
- Have you thought about suicide?
- Have you been so anxious you can't get out of bed?

Etc, etc puts into their heads the idea that themselves, or many of their peers are broken and cannot function properly in the real world.

It normalizes situations that would be incredibly rare at any other time in history. 

There's a lot of other takeaways, too, but I'll stop there.

It's a fantastic book. Go pick it up and read it. This isn't an affiliate thing or a promotion thing at all. I just really enjoyed it, and it will further shape the way I parent moving forward.",2024-03-07 19:12:14+00:00

"I never wanted to be a politician and I still don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve had two successful careers and have started a few small businesses. I‚Äôve also worked for some big corporations. I was ready to retire and spend more time with my family ‚Äì which I‚Äôve done for the past 3 years. I think they‚Äôre ready for me to find something else to do.

I‚Äôm tired of seeing the leaders of our country being influenced by the toxic divisions that are tearing apart our families and society. It‚Äôs time for me to step up and do my civic duty. To give back and try and change things for the better. If not me, who? If not now, when?

It‚Äôs easy to look at the economy and realize that something has gone horribly wrong. Working people, the middle class, and small businesses have been losing ground over the past 20 years. The goose that lays the golden eggs for our country has been kicked around and squeezed to the point where laying more golden eggs is almost impossible. Consider that since 2000 the cost of food has risen more than double the rise in average household income. The cost of a home has risen 6 times and the amount of government spending 5 and a half times. The S&P 500 has gone up 9 times more than the rise in average household income. To everyone who works and is trying to do the right thing for their family, to everyone who is young and wonders why their lives are worse than their parents: you are not wrong.

And yet, who have we allowed to have the most influence over our government? Big corporate executives and big union bosses. Big tech, big pharma, big media, big whatever ‚Äì all trying to control big government in Washington DC. This needs to stop. Our government spends money on the wrong things and spends way too much.

One thing the federal government should certainly be responsible for is the security of our borders. Instead, we see millions of people coming in without any accounting for who they are, what they intend to do, or what they‚Äôre bringing with them. And they‚Äôre being given access to all sorts of handouts at our expense. At a minimum, the federal government and the state governments should be working together to enforce existing laws and secure the border. Seeing our government at war with itself is unacceptable.

For my whole life, in every place I‚Äôve ever lived, I‚Äôve seen people working to provide for their family. Values like self-sacrifice, faith, integrity, fidelity, and valor are simply part of who these people are. They do these things not because the government tells them to, but because they know the right things to do - moral obligations that are freely chosen, not mandated by a government.

It doesn‚Äôt take a village to raise a child, it takes a family, and it takes families to make a village.

The sad reality is that many children in our country are suffering. Years of ridiculing and demeaning old fashioned ‚Äúfamily values‚Äù have taken a toll. Our society‚Äôs strength, fundamentally linked to the vitality of the family structure, has been eroded. I want to champion the traditional family as critical for a child‚Äôs development and success. The data proves this. However, my approach will be inclusive, recognizing all who step up to provide for their children. I‚Äôm not worried about the government being a safety net. I want the government to stop being an impediment.

I‚Äôm ready to go to DC and see if I can help bring back sanity and civility to the public discourse on these issues and all the other issues that face our great nation. We need bold leaders for such a time as this.

"Superconductivity requires a spin-up electron to pair with a spin-down electron, so that the pair has a net spin of zero and therefore obeys Bose-Einstein statistics, not Fermi-Dirac. This breaks them free from the Pauli exclusion principle, so you can have a great many of them occupying a low energy quantum state that can slide effortlessly through the material like a ghost. Every superconductor relies on exactly that effect.

What differs between materials is the way in which the electrons pair. Electrons don‚Äôt like to pair, because of their mutual Coulomb repulsion, but in some materials they can both jiggle the crystal lattice in a way that weakly brings them together, like an arranged marriage for a couple that‚Äôs not really into each other. This is called phonon coupling, and can be modeled with BCS theory, at least‚Ä¶ for simple crystal structures. That model predicts that superconductivity can only occur up to like 30 K, beyond which the lattice is jostling around too much because of temperature, so the pairing mechanism is disrupted.

However, there are some materials with complicated crystal structures, that get around the assumptions of BCS, and that are more robust when it comes to the effect of temperature on the pairing mechanism. For example, ReBCO, which I work with, can go up to ~90 K. This is a shockingly high number from the perspective of BCS, which is why these materials are called ‚Äúhigh temperature‚Äù superconductors, despite still having to be pretty cold (liquid nitrogen boils at 77 K). 

Anyway, the high T superconductors have more complicated and exotic pairing mechanisms. It‚Äôs no longer ‚Äúsimple‚Äù phonon coupling, but something that involves longer-range and more geometrically complicated details, and to this day it‚Äôs still not fully understood.

Although, the way supercurrent flows is well-understood, in all superconductors. It‚Äôs called the Ginsburg-Landau model, and is based on the idea that there‚Äôs some energy associated with electron pair formation, and some energy associated with pair-to-pair interactions, in addition to the usual electromagnetic terms. This model works extremely well, and is the basis for all superconducting technology.

One of the predictions of GL is that, when the condensation energy is nearly zero (around the Tc), there will be fluctuations where electrons temporarily pair and un-pair. These oscillations are extremely rapid, so in experiential measurements they will average out into a state that seems to be kinda superconducting, but not completely. But it‚Äôs really just fluctuating, a second-order phase transition. So that‚Äôs one cause of the transition width.

Another cause of the transition width is the purity of the sample, or lack thereof. A sample with varying quality throughout will have a wider transition, as some parts of it ‚Äúturn on‚Äù before others. 

With ReBCO, transition widths are typically a few K, with tails noticeable out to like a 10 K span, sometimes more. And dirty samples might have double or triple transitions, if different parts of it are oriented different ways.

Anyway, sorry for the novel of a response, but I hope that provides some context. Any Tc curve on a new superconducting sample is probably going to have quite a wide transition, for lack of sample purity, and also due to the fluctuations that thermodynamically should be there no matter what. So it seems extremely unlikely that a material which somehow superconducts at 4X the temperature of ReBCO would also have a much cleaner Tc transition.",2024-03-04 20:39:27+00:00

I used to ask myself why the Government numbers were always wrong. You just hit the button in the computer and figure it out. The problem is that that button doesn't exist. Nobody knows where the money is flowing.

The Government has an Authorized Executive stamp a bill and then that bill just gets paid. The Department gets a budget authorized to it by Congress --> it goes to OMB --> OMB allocates a budget --> that Department then just sends a money request to Treasury to pay. 

It's not reconciled against what happened. There's no Controller. The reason it cant pass audits is because you can't pass something you can't reconcile.""",2025-02-08 00:32:26+00:00

"The House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump on December 18, 2019, after a White House whistleblower went public with evidence that Trump abused his powers by withholding military aid to Ukraine in order to dig up dirt on his rival, Joe Biden. 

In the complaint, the whistleblower claimed to have heard from White House staff that Trump had, on a phone call, directed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. 

The whistleblower who triggered the impeachment was a CIA analyst who was first brought into the White House by the Obama administration.

Reporting by Drop Site News last year revealed that the CIA analyst relied on reporting by a supposedly independent investigative news organization called the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which appears to have effectively operated as an arm of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which President Trump has just shut down. The CIA whistleblower complaint cited a long report by OCCRP four times.

The OCCRP report alleged that two Soviet-born Florida businessmen were ‚Äúkey hidden actors behind a plan‚Äù by Trump to investigate the Bidens. According to the story, those two businessmen connected Giuliani to two former Ukrainian prosecutors. The OCCRP story was crucial to the House Democrats‚Äô impeachment claim, which is that Trump dispatched Giuliani as part of a coordinated effort to pressure a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, which is why the whistleblower cited it four times.

In a 2024 documentary that German television broadcaster NDR made about OCCRP‚Äôs dependence on the US government, a USAID official confirmed that USAID approves OCCRP‚Äôs ‚Äúannual work plan‚Äù and approves new hires of ‚Äúkey personnel.‚Äù NDR initiated and carried out the investigation with French investigative news organization Mediapart, Italian new group Il Fatto Quotidiano, Reporters United in Greece, and Drop Site News in the United States.

However, according to a Mediapart story published the same day as the Drop Site News article, NDR censored the broadcast ‚Äúafter US journalist Drew Sullivan, the co-founder and head of the OCCRP, placed pressure on the NDR management and made false accusations against the broadcaster‚Äôs journalists involved in the project.‚Äù

On December 16, Drop Site‚Äôs Ryan Grim posted a link on X to the 26-minute-long documentary. ‚ÄúNDR, Germany‚Äôs public broadcaster, is facing a censorship scandal and has defended itself by saying it never killed a news report about OCCRP and its State Department funding ‚Äî b/c no report was ever produced to kill,‚Äù said Grim. ‚ÄúThat was absurd ‚Äî and dozens, maybe hundreds, of journalists knew it to be false, and now of course, someone has leaked it.‚Äù

The journalistic collaboration revealed that OCCRP‚Äôs original funding came from the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs of the State Department, and quotes a USAID official who says, ‚ÄúDrew‚Äôs just nervous about being linked with law enforcement,‚Äù referring to Sullivan. ‚ÄúIf people who are going to give you information think you‚Äôre just a cop, maybe it‚Äôs a problem.‚Äù

OCCRP does not operate like a normal investigative journalism organization in that its goals appear to include interfering in foreign political matters, including elections, aimed at regime change. Sullivan told NDR that his organization had ‚Äúprobably been responsible for five or six countries changing over from one government to another government‚Ä¶ and getting prime ministers indicted or thrown out.‚Äù

As such, it appears that CIA, USAID, and OCCRP were all involved in the impeachment of President Trump in ways similar to the regime change operations that all three organizations engage in abroad. The difference is that it is highly illegal and even treasonous for CIA, USAID, and its contractors and intermediaries, known as ‚Äúcut-outs,‚Äù to interfere in US politics this way.

OCCRP threatened to file a lawsuit against Public in response to questions we sent. ‚ÄúThe premise of your article is factually false and defamatory,‚Äù wrote Miranda Patrucic, the Editor in Chief of OCCRP, over email. ‚ÄúThe claim by Dropsite News and partner media that USAID has control over editorial appointments has been disproven and we suggest you read our response to that.‚Äù

But neither OCCRP nor anyone else disproved Drop Site‚Äôs allegations and Drop Site stands by them. And the evidence does not support OCCRP‚Äôs claim of journalistic independence....

"üá∫üá∏üá∏üáª TRUMP AND RUBIO‚ÄôS PRISON DEAL WITH EL SALVADOR IS A LEGAL AND STRATEGIC MASTERSTROKE

Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have secured a historic agreement with El Salvador‚Äôs President Nayib Bukele that will allow the U.S. to deport violent criminals‚Äîregardless of nationality‚Äîto serve their sentences in El Salvador‚Äôs high-security mega-prison. This bold initiative will cut prison costs, reduce overcrowding, and enhance public safety by removing dangerous criminals from U.S. soil.

Critics argue that the U.S. cannot deport American citizens, but federal law provides clear pathways for this policy to be implemented legally. Under 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1227, lawful permanent residents can be deported for aggravated felonies, drug offenses, and crimes of moral turpitude. 

8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1481 allows the revocation of citizenship for naturalized citizens who engaged in terrorism, treason, or fraud in obtaining their status, meaning gang members who concealed their affiliations‚Äîsuch as MS-13 or Tren de Aragua‚Äîcould be stripped of citizenship and removed. 

Additionally, the International Prisoner Transfer Program (18 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 4100-4115) already allows for foreign nationals convicted in the U.S. to serve sentences in their home countries. This new agreement expands that concept by allowing El Salvador to house criminals from any nation, including those the U.S. wants to remove.

Bukele has already transformed El Salvador from one of the world‚Äôs deadliest nations to one of its safest by jailing over 83,000 gang members. His 40,000-inmate mega-prison, Cecot, has become a model for tough, no-nonsense incarceration, where criminals are locked down 24 hours a day with no rehabilitation programs or luxuries. 

Now, instead of spending $35,000 per inmate per year in U.S. prisons, America can outsource these costs to El Salvador at a fraction of the price, with Bukele proposing a flat fee per inmate to sustain his prison system while reducing U.S. expenses.

This agreement also strengthens Trump‚Äôs broader immigration enforcement strategy. The ‚ÄúSafe Third Country‚Äù framework, already in place with Guatemala, will now apply to El Salvador, ensuring that migrants arrested at the U.S. border can be sent there instead of remaining in the U.S. 

Criminals who illegally enter the U.S. and commit violent offenses will no longer clog up American prisons or be released due to overcrowding‚Äîthey will be swiftly transferred to El Salvador‚Äôs high-security facility. 

Venezuela has repeatedly refused to take back Tren de Aragua gang members arrested in the U.S., but now, these criminals can be sent to El Salvador‚Äôs prison system instead, removing them from American streets for good.

Trump and Rubio‚Äôs plan represents real action where past administrations have failed. For years, liberal policies have allowed criminal gangs to exploit legal loopholes, avoid deportation, and drain taxpayer dollars. 

This agreement closes those loopholes, removes dangerous criminals, and prioritizes law-abiding Americans over those who threaten public safety. 

With strong legal backing and a clear enforcement mechanism, this deal is a game-changer‚Äîproving once again that Trump and Rubio are willing to take bold steps to protect American citizens.

The CIA‚Äôs deception regarding COVID-19 origins becomes much clearer when considering USAID's long history of serving as a CIA front organization.

"Per grok

Here are 20 red flags of corruption or concerns regarding the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), based on the information available:

Lack of Bipartisanship: Despite being legally required to reflect the diversity of American society, NED is predominantly staffed and led by Democrats, which raises questions about its political neutrality.

Political Discrimination: Allegations suggest that NED discriminates against Republicans and conservatives in hiring practices, potentially skewing its operations towards one political ideology.

Duplication of Efforts: NED's activities often overlap with those of other U.S. government agencies, suggesting redundancy and potential inefficiency in the use of public funds.

Lack of Transparency: Since 2021, NED has not updated its online database of grants, reducing the transparency of its funding allocations.

Reduction in Reporting: NED ceased producing printable annual reports after 2017, opting for less detailed multimedia summaries, which might obscure detailed financial and operational transparency.

Board Composition: As of late 2023, the NED board had more members than the legally mandated maximum, potentially affecting governance.

Partisanship in Events and Activities: The organization's programs and events are often seen as favoring one political perspective over another, suggesting a lack of balance in promoting democratic ideals.

CIA-like Operations: NED has been described as a continuation of the CIA's covert activities under a different guise, raising concerns about its true purpose and methods.

Interference in Elections: NED has been accused of influencing election outcomes in countries like Bolivia by funding media and NGOs to highlight alleged election fraud by incumbent governments.

Funding Opposition Movements: NED's support for opposition groups in various countries, often in line with U.S. foreign policy, can be seen as interference in domestic politics.

Manipulation of Narratives: There are claims that NED manipulates public opinion by funding media outlets and NGOs that promote narratives favorable to U.S. interests.

Undesirable NGO Status: Russia labeled NED as an ""undesirable"" organization in 2015, highlighting concerns over foreign interference in domestic affairs.

Historical Ties to CIA: The origins of NED as a response to expose CIA activities suggest a continuity in strategic objectives despite changes in operation from covert to overt.

Funding of Anti-Government Protests: NED has been linked to funding protests and opposition movements, like those during the Euromaidan in Ukraine, which could destabilize countries.

Selective Democracy Support: NED tends to support ""democracy activists"" in countries where U.S. geopolitical interests are at stake, questioning the purity of its democratic motives.

Infiltration and Subversion: Accusations of NED engaging in subversive activities, including ideological infiltration in regions like Europe and Latin America.

Support for ""Color Revolutions"": NED's involvement in various ""color revolutions"" worldwide indicates a strategic use of democracy promotion for geopolitical gain.

Lack of Accountability: There's a call for oversight and investigation into NED's operations, particularly its role in censoring U.S. citizens and its hiring practices.

Funding of Controversial NGOs: NED has funded organizations with controversial agendas or methods, raising ethical questions about the nature of the ""democracy"" it promotes.

Strategic Autonomy Suppression: In Europe, NED has been accused of suppressing voices for strategic autonomy in favor of transatlanticism, manipulating EU policy.

These red flags suggest areas where NED's activities might not align with its mission to promote democracy or could be indicative of broader geopolitical strategies rather than pure democratic support.",2025-02-02 16:35:42+00:00

This robot will make the decision before revalidating that the vehicle is being put back into service. 

This shows the kind of engineering that is going into making every ride awesome. 

I've been interviewing @Waymo customers and they say once in a while a dirty one arrives and it reduces their happiness with the experience.

Waymo has nothing like this and doesn't have enough vehicles on the road to fill in. Waits for Waymo's often take 15 minutes, so if a dirty one arrives you will have waited 30 minutes for a drive, which means unhappy customers who probably will just order an Uber. 

When I interviewed Travis Kalanick at Stanford University he told me that they knew that the best customer satisfaction came when a vehicle arrived in one minute. Longer meant unhappy customers. 

This is why having the supercharger network is so important, too. Adding one of these robots next to a super charger is an obvious move. So a Cybercab will go to charge and be cleaned at the same time. Waymo can't compete with that because it doesn't have a worldwide system of chargers already built. 

The other thing most people don't get about robotics is that they get faster over time. So, while this looks slow today, in two years when Robotaxi network really starts up at scale, it'll be dramatically faster than this video shows.",2025-01-31 17:34:51+00:00

"Here are some thoughts after over a year of litigating Brigida v Department of Transportion, a DEI Air Traffic Control case against the Biden FAA and DOJ:

The FAA pushed its radical DEI agenda for decades. It watered down the air traffic control aptitude test multiple times for the stated purpose of increasing Air Traffic Control(ATC) diversity, until finally a questionable character self-assessment was worth far more than the ability to understand flight paths and intersecting angles.

Under both the Obama and Biden Administrations, the FAA was influenced by DEI fanatics to change its air traffic control hiring process. Rather than stick with the science, the agency used an ATC aptitude test ‚Äì if it can even be called that ‚Äì that prioritized skin color and sex over actual competence.

During the Obama Administration more than 2000 qualified & vetted men and women were lined up to become air traffic controllers. They‚Äôd demonstrated their competence and eagerness to protect the American skies and were just waiting on orders from the government. The order that came was to remove them from the ATC queue altogether. The reason: Obama‚Äôs FAA decided they weren‚Äôt racially diverse enough.

The Obama Administration threw out the results of an ATC aptitude test proven to select the best candidates in favor of a 10 minute self-assessment that had zero guardrails against cheating and even less to do with air traffic. Anyone who failed according to the FAA‚Äôs secret scoring system was denied the job, no matter how highly they‚Äôd scored on the actual ATC aptitude test.

In the name of DEI, Obama‚Äôs FAA instituted an air traffic control hiring exam that awarded applicants points for being bad at science in high school, being unemployed, and having below average communication skills. The candidates who were actually qualified to be ATCs but were denied the chance to protect American skies because they didn‚Äôt pass this sham test sued to correct the injustice, but the Biden admin championed the DEI cause in court with even greater ferocity.

Back in 2013 the Obama Administration promised a ‚Äúhistoric transformation‚Äù of the FAA. To make our skies safer? To become more technologically advanced? To study flight patterns of the busiest airspace? Obama‚Äôs promise was to make air traffic control a more diverse and inclusive workforce, and Biden doubled down on it. 

Talent and experience for these jobs is a long pipeline. Losing so many qualified applicants out of only 14,000 Air Traffic Controllers, and losing potentially countless applicants since, has resulted in chronic staffing shortages and serious overtime. 

No sane American cares about ATC sex and skin color, because they know it‚Äôs an obsession that, as I predicted many times last year and as recently as 2 weeks ago, would result in tragedy.",2025-01-31 17:12:25+00:00

- One year ago it was widely reported that there was a hiring shortage for air traffic controllers because of the DIE quotas 

- the TSA has absolutely nothing to do with airplane crashes. Even you understand that people who pat other people down, have no impact on landing an airplane.

- the commission you‚Äôre talking about advises TSA and therefore is also irrelevant.

- despite knowing there was a shortage and despite last year, multiple almost crashes that occurred under the watch of Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, Democrats refused to scrap their deadly and dangerous DIE quotas in the aviation space.

"ELON: IRRATIONAL REGULATIONS ARE AN INVISIBLE TAX ON HUMANITY

‚ÄúYou really can think of the United States and many countries ‚Äì it's arguably worse in the EU ‚Äì as being like Gulliver, tied down by a million little strings.

Any one given regulation is not that bad, but you've got millions of them.

Eventually, you just can't get anything done.

This is a massive tax on the consumer, on the people.

It's just that they don't realize that there's this massive tax in the form of irrational regulations.

I'll give you a recent example that is just insane.

SpaceX was fined by the EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] $140,000 for, they claimed, dumping potable water on the ground, drinking water.

This is at Starbase, and we're like, we're in a tropical thunderstorm region.

That stuff comes from the sky all the time.

You know, it was just water to cool the launch pad during liftoff.

And there's zero harm done.

And they agree: Yes, there's zero harm done.

We're like, okay, so there's no harm done, and you want us to pay a $140,000 fine?

Yes, because you didn't have a permit.

We didn't know there was a permit needed for zero-harm, fresh water being on the ground in a place where fresh water falls from the sky all the time.

I mean, sometimes it rains so much the roads are flooded.

So we're like, how does this make any sense?

And they were like, we're not going to process any more of your applications for Starship launch unless you pay this $140,000.

"Glenn Greenwald On Brazil's Alexandre De Moraes' Authoritarian Censorship Regime Targeting Elon Musk, Starlink, and ùïè

Context and Situation:
In Brazil, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has initiated aggressive actions against X, compelling the platform to comply with censorship orders targeting political figures. The orders demand the removal of elected senators and congress members from the platform, actions which X has resisted due to their political motivation and lack of due process. In response, de Morais has threatened to arrest X executives in Brazil and demanded that X appoint a legal representative in the country to enforce these orders.

X‚Äôs Response:
Elon Musk, owner of X, announced the closure of all X offices in Brazil and the relocation of its executives outside the country, citing safety concerns. Despite this, de Morais issued a 24-hour ultimatum for X to comply with the censorship orders or face being blocked in Brazil entirely, leaving the platform inaccessible to all Brazilians except those using VPNs.

Legal and Political Maneuvers:
De Moraes‚Äô demands are part of a broader trend in which authoritarian regimes exert control over online platforms to suppress dissent. This has extended beyond X, with the blocking of financial assets of Starlink, another Musk-owned company, despite no wrongdoing on its part. De Moraes‚Äô actions align with increasing censorship efforts seen in Brazil and other nations, where governments seek to maintain control over public discourse by stifling opposition voices online.

Global Context and Implications:
This situation is part of a global pattern where governments, both in democratic and authoritarian states, are increasingly imposing stringent controls over internet platforms. These controls are often justified by claims of national security or the need to prevent misinformation, yet they effectively limit free speech and the exchange of ideas. The trend began intensifying around 2016, following political events like Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, which demonstrated the power of the internet in shaping public opinion independent of traditional media gatekeepers.

Conclusion:
The actions by Brazil‚Äôs Supreme Court, particularly those of Justice De Moraes, represent a significant threat to internet freedom. They illustrate how governments can leverage legal and economic pressures to force compliance with censorship demands, thus curtailing the ability of platforms like X to serve as open forums for public debate. This reflects a broader, concerning trend of increasing censorship and control over online spaces by governments worldwide, undermining democratic principles and the free exchange of ideas.

@ggreenwald Quotes:

""The indescribably authoritarian judge on the Brazil Supreme Court, Alessandra de Morais, who essentially runs the country, threatened X's Brazilian executives that they would immediately be arrested if X did not instantly comply with censorship orders to censor elected members of the Senate and the Congress.

""There's no due process provided, and these people have not been convicted of crimes. It's just this politically motivated judge ordering these people banned from the internet. X did not want to cooperate with that, so this threat was issued. We're going to arrest X executives inside Brazil unless you comply.""

""It's expected, especially for Western companies, that they're not going to comply with authoritarian regimes and shut down all opposition. That is considered immoral. All of the authoritarian countries that we are taught to hate have had a constant conflict with big tech over its refusal to censor dissidents or opponents of the government, and now this is contaminating the Western world.""

""In 2022, Elon Musk was awarded official commendations from Brazil's authorities for his benevolent act of providing free internet connections to many of the poorest areas in Brazil that the government hadn't been able to provide on their own. And yet, somehow, this judge, even though there's no finding that Starlink itself did anything wrong, has blocked Starlink's bank accounts in Brazil to punish X.""

""It is genuinely remarkable the lengths to which not just Brazil but countries throughout the democratic world are now willing to go to prevent the internet from being a free exchange of ideas where human beings can organize freely and privately because they recognize that is the one threat to establishment power and the status quo ruling class prerogatives.""

""This is happening in the ostensibly Western democratic world. I cannot do anything more in terms of words to express how extreme, how severe, and how dangerous this trend is.""

"ELON: COMMUNITY NOTES ARE THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON FOR COMBATING DISINFORMATION

@elonmusk:

‚ÄúNow that we have community notes, which, while it's not perfect, I think, it's the best fact-checking that I've seen on the internet.¬†

And so, if someone were to post false information, they can be community-noted.¬†

No fact-checking system is perfect.¬†

If perfection is the standard, you can just basically dispense with all fact-checking, because nothing will be perfect.¬†

My observation of community notes is that the batting average, the probability that the note is correct is very high, much better than anything else that I've seen on the internet.¬†

And everything in community notes, the code, the data, everything is open source, so you can independently recreate the outcome of any note as a third party.¬†

I think that having the community notes capability is very powerful; it's the most powerful weapon that is actually combating disinformation.‚Äù

"FRANCE IS FOR CRIME, AGAINST FREEDOM

Fran√ßois asks a good question. My answer is: France doesn't care about crime, they care about control.

1) First, Macron hasn't wiped out crime among 70M Frenchmen with all the power of the French State. So it's completely unreasonable to expect Durov to wipe out crime among 1B+ Telegram users with his minimal power of content moderation.

2) Second, the deeper point is that the French state is deeply uninterested in public safety! They allow violent crime, fundamentalist terrorism, and drug dealing to run rampant in France. Just compare Paris to what it was a few generations ago.

3) Third, is Macron held personally responsible for every beheading, rape, and robbery that occurs on French soil? Is he jailed when traveling for violating the human rights of French citizens by not ""moderating"" his community hard enough? No, he is not. Even though the tools of the French state are vastly greater than those of Telegram, over a vastly smaller userbase. Again: Macron has ~70M citizens to deal with, while Telegram has almost 1B users.

4) Finally, we already know what a real anti-crime policy looks like. It looks like @nayibbukele. And President Bukele is for encryption, and has invited programmers to build on El Salvadoran soil ‚Äî an offer they'd be well-advised to take up.

5) So: France is an anarcho-tyrannical regime. It doesn't need sophisticated surveillance to stop drug dealing ‚Äî¬†because it's all happening in public! They know exactly where the criminals are, and the victims too. They are literally setting up spaces for them to do drugs till they die.

"The Human Advantage by @suzanahh

The author was the inventor of the delightful ‚Äúbrain soup‚Äù method of accurately estimating neuron counts in entire brains by dissolving the cell walls and counting stained nuclei in a representative sample.

This is all from the last decade or two, so it is a good tale of ‚Äúlive science‚Äù, where widely held theories like https://t.co/2XrKIC4AeH¬†and the straightforward versions of https://t.co/scjUqKSnSR¬†turn out to not be right, and it is impossible to even track down where some of the institutional lore that everyone accepted even came from.

The key points are:

Primate brains have better scaling properties with size than other mammals, with neuron count increasing linearly with volume, unlike other mammals where larger brains have proportionately fewer neurons.

Humans are standard primates as far as brains go, fitting in nicely with the whole range of smaller primates. The larger great apes are the outliers for having relatively smaller brains than other primates, but still with the same exceptional neuron density.

Absolute neocortex neuron count is the primary metric for ‚Äúsmart‚Äù.

"The collapsing birth rate is actually way worse than you think.

One of the biggest things I've realized since becoming a father 3 months ago is that I spend an obscene amount of time thinking about the future.

This is because I want my child to have the best possible place to grow up in.

And thus, I spend way too much time looking at how society is functioning today and where the weaknesses are.

What's becoming painfully clear is that everything is broken.

Our Government overspends like crazy and they never tell the truth.

Our corporations are way too bloated, rarely innovate, and they are more than comfortable lowering quality over time while increasing profit margins.

Our Mainstream Media is a national embarrassment and is nothing more than a propaganda machine for the government.

I am now constantly filled with a sense of dread. It feels like a good future is almost impossible given the amount of stuff that is completely broken today.

However - once I start thinking about the past, and compare it to today, I realize that things are so much better than they used to be, so it gives me hope that a better future is possible with enough effort and pain.

But here's the MASSIVE problem - without a child, I would've never felt as motivated as I do now to make the future a better place.

And then it dawned on me that the declining birth rate is not just a simple math problem - it fundamentally de-incentivizes civilization to look forward.

This means that there are less people now - more than ever in recent recorded history - that don't have that child making it painfully obvious how broken everything is, and how desperately we need to make everything better for our children.

Instead, we are distracted by ever-increasing technological wonders that will be maximally optimized to draw your attention away from reality using AI algorithms.

We are distracted by amazing products and services, and incredible destinations to visit.

We are distracted by social media platforms that make it extremely difficult to stop paying attention to them.

We are truly in a very, very, very dangerous place.

We need more people speaking up about things that need to be fixed.

We need more entrepreneurs tackling difficult problems.

We need more public servants that have the people's best interest in mind.

We need so much.

But more important than all - we need more children.

Children are the future, and without them, the future will disappear.

Literally.

"Democrats, in a stunning display of irony, are building an impenetrable wall around their convention in Chicago and demanding ID from everyone entering the venue. This comes from the same party that decries walls as racist and insists that requiring ID is discriminatory. Meanwhile, all the appointments for free vasectomies for Democrat men at the convention have already filled up.

_________________________

In a move that would be laughable if it weren‚Äôt so hypocritical, the Democratic Party is set to erect an impenetrable wall around their convention venue in Chicago and require photo ID from everyone who wants to attend. Yes, you read that correctly. The very party that has spent years branding walls as racist and denouncing voter ID laws as discriminatory is now embracing both when it serves their interests.

For years, Democrats have vilified anyone who dares suggest that America needs secure borders. They‚Äôve gone so far as to label the construction of a border wall as an act of racism. Yet, when it comes to protecting their own, suddenly walls are a necessity. The message is clear: walls for us, but not for thee.

And let‚Äôs talk about the ID requirement. We‚Äôve heard it all before from the left‚Äîdemanding ID is discriminatory, it disenfranchises voters, it‚Äôs racist. Yet, when it comes to their convention, ID suddenly becomes essential. If Democrats truly believe that requiring ID is oppressive, why are they so quick to enforce it when their own security is on the line? The irony is staggering.

But the absurdity doesn‚Äôt stop there. Appointments for free vasectomies for Democrat men at the convention have already filled up. It‚Äôs almost as if they‚Äôre taking their dedication to population control to a whole new level. The left has long championed the idea of controlling the population through abortion and now, it seems, they‚Äôre encouraging sterilization as well.

This whole situation reeks of hypocrisy. It‚Äôs a classic case of ‚Äúrules for thee, but not for me.‚Äù When it comes to protecting their own interests, Democrats are more than willing to throw their so-called principles out the window. Whether it‚Äôs building walls, demanding ID, or promoting population control, they‚Äôll do whatever it takes to maintain their power.

The double standards on display here are just too glaring to ignore. The Democratic Party has revealed, yet again, that their true agenda is not about fairness or equality, but about control. Control of the borders when it suits them, control of the voting process when it benefits them, and control of the population through whatever means necessary.

As we watch the events unfold at the Democratic convention, we‚Äôre reminded once more that the left‚Äôs hypocrisy knows no bounds. They‚Äôll preach one thing and practice another, all in the name of power. And the American people are expected to sit back and accept it.

But we won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs time to call out this hypocrisy for what it is. The Democrats can‚Äôt have it both ways. If they‚Äôre going to build walls and demand ID at their convention, they should be held accountable for the same actions they‚Äôve demonized in others. The American people deserve leaders who stand by their principles, not ones who twist them to suit their convenience.

So, as the Democrats gather behind their walls and check IDs at the door, let‚Äôs remember what this says about their true values. It‚Äôs not about fairness or justice‚Äîit‚Äôs about control. And that‚Äôs something every American should be concerned about.",2024-08-18 17:33:46+00:00

"People need to stop overreacting about Kamala‚Äôs plan to reduce food inflation, as if it would lead to communism, mass starvation, and the end of America.

I worked in M&A in the food industry. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step summary of what would actually happen:

1. The government announces that grocery retailers aren‚Äôt allowed to raise prices.

2. Grocery stores, which operate on 1-2% net margins, can‚Äôt survive if their suppliers raise prices. So the government announces that food producers (Kraft Heinz, ConAgra, Tyson, Hormel, et. al.) also aren‚Äôt allowed to raise prices.

3. Not all grocery stores are created equal. Stores in lower-income areas make less money than those in higher-income areas, as the former disproportionately sell lower-margin prepackaged foods (‚Äúcenter of the store‚Äù) instead of higher-margin fresh products like meat (‚Äúperimeter of the store‚Äù). Because stores in lower-income areas aren‚Äôt able to cover overhead (remember, even if their wholesale costs are fixed, their labor, utilities, insurance, and other operating expenses aren‚Äôt fixed‚Ä¶ yet), grocery chains start to shut them down. Food deserts in rural areas and in low-income urban areas alike become worse.

4. Meanwhile, margins for food producers are also quickly eroding. Their primary costs (ingredients, energy, and labor) aren‚Äôt fixed, and their shrinking gross profits leave less cash flow available to cover overhead, maintain facilities, and reinvest in additional production capacity.

5. Grocery chains, which have finite shelf space, start to repurpose their stores (those they didn‚Äôt have to shut down, I should say) to sell more non-price-controlled items‚Äîeverything from nutrition supplements to kitchenware to apparel‚Äîand less price-controlled food products. Your local Kroger or Safeway starts to look and feel more like a Walmart.

6. Food producers stop making products with lower margins. Grocery chain start competing with each other to secure inventory. Since they can‚Äôt compete by offering stronger prices (remember, producers aren‚Äôt allowed to raise prices here, and, even if they could, grocery chains no longer have the gross profit to bear price increases), they compete on things like payment terms.

7. Small grocery chains start to shut down entirely, or get sold to larger chains like Kroger. In addition to not being able to cover fixed costs, a major reason for this is because they can no longer reliably secure delivery of products, due to producers prioritizing sales to larger customers, which are able to leverage their stronger balance sheets to offer superior payment terms.

8. Smaller food producers‚Äîwhich typically sell via distributors, rather than directly to grocery chains‚Äîstart to go out of business. Because these producers have an additional step their value chains, and because they have lower volumes over which to spread their fixed costs, their cost structure is inherently disadvantaged compared to major food producers. When grocery stores aren‚Äôt able to raise prices, cutting product costs becomes all the more important, and deprioritizing purchases from smaller producers is an easy way to do so.

9. As supply chains break down, lines start to form outside grocery stores every morning. Cities assign police officers to patrol store parking lots, and food producers draft contingency plans to assign armed escorts to delivery trucks.

10. The federal government announces a program to issue block grants for states to purchase and operate shuttered grocery stores. The USDA also seizes closed-down production facilities.

11. The government announces that prices for all key food costs‚Äîcorn, wheat, cattle, energy, etc.‚Äîare also now fixed, to stop ‚Äúprofiteers‚Äù from gouging the now-government-operated food industry.

12. Shockingly, the government struggles to operate one of the most complex industries on the planet. The entire food supply chain starts imploding.

13. Communism, mass starvation, and the end of America quickly ensue.

"üö®üáßüá∑COURT DOCUMENT REVEALS BRAZILIAN SUPREME COURT'S CENSORSHIP ORDERS TO X

A newly released official document from Brazil's Federal Supreme Court, signed by Minister Alexandre de Moraes, exposes the court's efforts to censor and control certain profiles on the X platform.

The document directs the administrator of X Brasil Internet Ltda. to block specified profiles within 24 hours and preserve access logs, connections, and all related data from specific dates.

Failure to comply with these orders could result in a daily fine of 50,000 reais (approximately $10,000 USD) for the platform.

The targeted profiles, which include a pastor, a current parliamentarian, and the wife of a former parliamentarian, are allegedly linked to ""illegal activities"". 

The court demands detailed information on their access records and associated data.

Minister Moraes, known for his role in censorship efforts under the Lula government, emphasized the need for confidentiality as the investigation continues.

The document once again raises serious concerns about free speech and government overreach in Brazil, as the Supreme Court appears to be actively suppressing dissent and controlling the narrative on social media.

@DrREpstein explains, ""When we factor Google out in 2020, Trump would have won 11 of the 13 swing states and easily won in the electoral college. Moreover, we calculated that Google shifted at least 6 million votes to Joe Biden, whom I supported btw, although I regret that... If you factor Google out of that election, the popular vote itself would have been virtually tied.""

In the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election and the 2021 Senate runoff elections in Georgia, his team found that 93% of election-related videos suggested by YouTube had a strong liberal bias.

Moreover, in 2019, former Google engineer Zach Vorhies (@Perpetualmaniac) leaked 950 pages of internal documents, exposing how Google uses blacklists and algorithms to censor conservative and pro-Trump content. 

Google had blacklisted hundreds of conservative websites on Android devices, preventing them from appearing in search results, including Daily Caller, Western Journal, RedState, Gateway Pundit, Steven Crowder, and Glenn Beck.

This is why @elonmusk's purchase of X, his commitment to open-sourcing the algorithm, and his efforts to create a politically neutral platform are seen as such a threat to the political establishment.

"Why Progressives Need to Care About Demographic Decline
In recent years, concern about birthrates and the need for more children has come to be seen as a conservative issue. Most on the left are much less worried about population decline. They point out that even though fertility has fallen, global population continues to rise. Most progressives reason that an end to population growth will give the planet a breather and represents a positive turn toward sustainability.

Shouldn't we celebrate falling birthrates as a victory for women‚Äôs rights? In any case, we aren't about to run out of people.

Yet a shrinking and aging world is not what most people think it will be. The places in the world that have depopulated and grown old do not match the progressive vision of fewer, but healthier and more thriving people. They do not fit anyone‚Äôs idea of sustainability.

Instead, places losing people are depressed areas of decay and blight. Without the vibrancy of youth or an underlying sense of progress, the world will be sadder and drearier, and a whole lot poorer.

Stabilization? Don‚Äôt we wish!
In 1968 when Paul Ehrlich published The Population Bomb, the total fertility rate was 6.51 births per woman in China, 5.76 births per woman in India and 5.2 births per woman in Brazil. If those rates continued indefinitely, we would have big problems. Whatever the carrying capacity of Earth (and the fact that the world is better fed than ever shows that it is a lot higher than Ehrlich thought) it certainly isn‚Äôt infinite.

From that perspective, falling birthrates seem like a good thing. Unfortunately, the data show we have blown past 'balanced' birthrates in most countries and now things are crashing. Demographers sort of assumed that falling birth rates would settle down to around replacement and then hover there. That hasn‚Äôt happened. Almost no country that fell below replacement is managing a ‚Äòsoft landing‚Äô.

The fertility rate is now 1.9 births per woman in India, 1.57 births per woman in Brazil and just 1.02 births per woman in China, and still falling fast in all of these countries. Meanwhile very old countries like Germany, Japan and Spain, which fell below replacement many decades ago and have been trying to recover, just keep declining. Germany‚Äôs fertility is just 1.35 births per woman, less than 2/3 of replacement, while Japan is at just 1.20 and Spain‚Äôs fertility is a mere 1.13. Countries that fell below replacement aren‚Äôt steadying, they just keep crashing.

America‚Äôs fertility is only 1.6 births per woman, just 75% to 80% of replacement and far below the 2.7 children American women say they want (according to a 2023 Gallup poll). America makes up the difference with immigration, but soon all but the poorest and least-educated countries will face a demographic shortfall. The pool of skilled potential immigrants from around the world is drying up.

Meanwhile, the United Nations‚Äô projections that everyone relies on are perennially much too high, based on the false hope that fertility rates will instantly stabilize after a precipitous fall. Every year, fertility instead continues its trend downward. For example, here is Argentina, according to the UN:

Somehow Argentina‚Äôs crashing birthrates will magically stabilize in an instant, the UN optimistically projects. (Spoiler, Argentina‚Äôs fertility rate for the first half of 2024 was just 1.28, already well below the latest UN projections and still falling.)

It takes a population pyramid to see what is really happening
A big part of the problem is that we think about population wrong. We see total population at or near its highest levels and think that surely the problem must be too many people rather than too few.

But total population is a poor metric for what is unfolding. Consider South Korea.

Korea is facing steep decline with a fertility rate that is just 1/3 of replacement. There are so few Korean children being born that for every 100 Koreans there will be just four Koreans three generations out. But if you look just at total population, the problem is completely hidden from view.

It‚Äôs hard to have progress if the world is declining
Almost all of us share something foundational in our worldview, and that is the idea of progress, however you define it. We have come to take for granted that the future will be better than the past. Life expectancies will keep increasing. Technology will keep improving. Science will advance and conditions will continue to improve.

Based on that, we assume that the mantra ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù will continue to hold true. We expect that human rights will keep expanding and progress as we have known it will continue.

All that progress has come on the back of large populations in countries that embrace new knowledge and invest to develop new technology. Yet those countries are the very ones that are disappearing the fastest.

Consider that the parts of the world that are below replacement account for more than 90% of global GDP, and more than 95% of patents and scientific publishing.

As the population of technologically and scientifically advanced countries is set to dwindle, many imagine that things will be fine because some poor countries still have a lot of children. But some of those countries are not even interested in carrying progress forward.

Consider Afghanistan. Afghanistan‚Äôs recipe for fertility is to reject modernity, even to the point that girls are banned from education past the sixth grade. The education of boys is hardly better. The system that gives Afghanistan its high birthrate bears almost no relation to the scientifically advancing world that most of us want for the future.

If progress is the goal, we are unlikely to get it by looking to the least progressive countries for our demographic salvation.

What population decline really looks like
There is a happy vision that many have of a future world of declining population. There will be fewer of us, people think, but we will be more technologically advanced, healthier and richer.

What? Are we forgetting what declining places are really like? Think of Detroit, rural West Virginia and rural Japan. Detroit is pictured below. How is this a happy ending for the environment?

Oh, and by the way, the people in these depopulating regions aren‚Äôt doing well at all. The locales in America that are losing population have some of the worst social indicators of well-being, with deaths of despair being the most tragic metric.

Needless to say, these are rarely nice places to visit. Buildings that are unoccupied decay, rust and slowly fall down. The sense of missing people is sad. These are economically depressed places too, with many businesses closed and sales dwindling in the others because of too few customers.

What happens to real estate prices in areas that are depopulating? In Detroit, rural West Virginia, and rural Japan the answer is the same. When sellers vastly exceed buyers in a town that is losing people, many properties cannot catch a bid at any price, and so they go all the way to zero. Investing to maintain real estate that nobody will buy or rent is a guaranteed way to lose money, and so a great deal of property in such places is just left to decay.

Meanwhile, the recent population trend of Detroit, rural West Virginia, and rural Japan is the future almost everywhere else. Do we think this will be fine?

In fact, almost all investment is based on the assumption of growth. Who would invest in a store, factory or company if every year sales will be less than the year before?

We haven‚Äôt even begun to talk about the impact of declining demographics on things like pensions and social benefits programs. But we already know the answer. Detroit went bankrupt. Japan is struggling under a mountain of debt. West Virginia gets by because of spending from the Federal government.

When social safety nets go bust, the results are catastrophic for regular people. In Russia in the 1990s, life expectancy plunged when safety nets disappeared. If America or another developed country goes bankrupt or can no longer afford social spending due to population decline and aging, the human cost will be staggering.

The arc of history is moving toward pronatalism. Do progressives just plan to just cede one of the most important issues of the future to the right?
Demographic decline is not a made-up problem but a looming calamity that anyone who understands arithmetic and compounding should be able to understand. A post of mine from this Wednesday, which went viral and was retweeted by @ElonMusk included a New York Times chart showing that births plunged by an average of 5% around the world between 2022 and 2023. If GDP numbers where down 5% year over year, we would be talking about little else, and yet births keep dropping, every year.

The world of the future will be pulled hard in a pro-natal direction. Just as tragedy and continued demographic threat has turned Israel toward pronatalism, so the severe stress that is coming will bend the United States and most countries in that direction.

Do progressives just plan to deny the crisis until it is plain to all, and leave the issue to conservatives? Do progressives believe that the right would do a better job with this than they would? Does history suggest that?

A lot of conservatives heed the advice of Napoleon: ‚ÄúNever interfere with your enemy when he is making a mistake‚Äù and revel in the very low birthrates of those on the political left. That is shortsighted and will leave us all worse off.

We will not remember well those who ignore this growing problem, or treat it like a political football, on either side.

Progressives are supposed to have a positive vision for the future
The depressing view of the antinatalism sub on Reddit (221K members, nearly all on the left), is that humanity should simply wind down because life is not worth living. That nihilistic outlook is surprisingly prevalent on the left today. Why aren't such ideas being forcefully rejected? By every objective measure, life is better today than it was for most of human history and nearly everyone is glad to be alive.

Progressives of the past would not understand people like this at all. The left of the past always had a positive vision of a bright human future, even when their policy prescriptions weren‚Äôt so great. Just look at every political poster ever. This strange despair about the future, so prevalent on the left today, would be out of place in any other era.

Those who care about the long run will surely have to turn toward pronatalism in some form. Because of how far birthrates have fallen, the status quo can‚Äôt hold. Given that, wouldn‚Äôt it better to lead on this than to follow?

The most effective solutions are cultural, and in culture, progressives have real power
Is the left powerless on falling birthrates? Hardly! Remember that it was progressives who took the lead when it seemed that overpopulation was looming and have been quite successful (much too successful in fact) in using culture, persuasion, technology and education to shift birthrates lower. That power has not gone away.

There is a lot of low hanging fruit to lift birthrates if the willpower is there:
¬∑ Educate young people (especially in high-school health class) on the fertility window and the commonness of unplanned childlessness. Lack of planning and awareness early on is the biggest reason people fail to have the children they desire. Since the average woman will have fewer children than she wanted, just helping young people to know the terrain will go a long way toward solving the problem.
¬∑ Shorten education tracks, created with men in mind, to accommodate the timescales of women who hope to have families.
¬∑ Talk up marriage, the preferred vehicle for having a family for people across the spectrum.
¬∑ Reject environmental or other doomerism that leads anti-natal sentiment.
¬∑ Simply explain that low birthrates are a problem and that our society needs more children to thrive. Most people want to do good in the world and are already looking for how. ‚ÄòHave and raise children‚Äô may be the best answer today. 
(As Israel, France and the Republic of Georgia have all found, simple pronatal messages can remarkably effective.)

"üá¨üáßDOES THE UK HAVE A TWO-TIER JUSTICE PROBLEM?

Ricky Jones, a Labour councilor who allegedly called for the murder of right-wing protesters, has been remanded in custody after appearing in court.

A video surfaced of him appearing to call them ""disgusting Nazi fascists,"" saying, ""We need to cut their throats and get rid of them.""

His lawyer called for leniency, claiming Jones was not driven by an ""ideological narrative.""

While he was held, pending a further hearing in September, his case appears to be moving more slowly than others.

Jordan Parlour was jailed for 20 months for posting: ""Every man and their dog should be smashing f**k out Britannia Hotel,"" referring to a hotel that was home to 210 refugees and asylum seekers.

Although the UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed swift justice for protesters, Ricky's case has raised questions about whether that only applies to the anti-immigration demonstrators.

"I am crossing the Rubicon and backing the Republican Party and President Trump.

Many ‚Äî including a former version of myself ‚Äî get trapped in a mental framework that becomes their identity and prevents them from radically evolving their thinking with new facts and information. I finally broke free from it.

My journey has been a gradual political 180 from where I stood in every previous election. It has been an eye-opening process of disenchantment, zero-basing lifelong beliefs, and rebuilding from there.

In 2017, a good friend enlisted me to pitch the DNC to raise $100M from Silicon Valley founders and executives. The aim was to use these funds and know-how to build a CRM and tech platform to prevent a repeat of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs inadequate, outdated 2016 campaign. We met with DNC leadership, who told us we could raise that money, but it would have to go to the general fund; a single-digit percentage would then be allocated to tech. In the wake of one of their most shocking failures, they didn‚Äôt want the help.

The next series of realizations began in 2019 while I was at Meta, right after we announced the Libra white paper. I testified before the Senate and the House and subsequently spent significant time in DC, engaging with lawmakers, cabinet members, regulators, and two White House administrations. At the time, I still believed the mainstream idea that Democrats were all about serving the People. However, I was shocked to learn that, for the most part, Republicans cared more deeply about their constituents, while Democrats, in my experience, cared more about government power and control. This is my observation on balance, with many stories to back it up. I also found that more Republicans wanted to understand our project‚Äôs goals and took the time to learn about the risks of censoring payments and controlling the network. I found myself remarkably aligned with them.

Then COVID came, revealing more. While I don‚Äôt subscribe to the most malicious vaccine conspiracy theories, I do take offense at the censorship machine put in place to hide the origin of the virus from the NIH-funded Wuhan lab and all dissenting voices on vaccinations and lockdowns. At that time, I fully appreciated why Republicans value freedom of speech and preventing censorship.

This trend of spinning and manufacturing a parallel reality to serve the Dem agenda, solidified by complicit mainstream media, hit home with the Hunter Biden laptop story, the coordinated vilification of President Trump and his followers, and President Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline ‚Äî depriving voters of a voice in a proper primary. These examples displayed the hubris of the current Dem leadership. You must think the American people are fools to believe the spin on these issues. I despise this elite vs. general population ideology viscerally.

This version of the Democratic Party is sidelining moderates and centrists and has adopted an increasingly leftist ideology. This drift to the left has dictated policies from which I‚Äôve found myself estranged.

On the domestic front, there has been a total departure from the core American value system of meritocracy, an extreme and weaponized DEI agenda, an open door to massive illegal immigration, and a once-fringe narrative, now mainstream within the party, of vilifying success. This shift is also causing us to fall behind due to an anti-innovation regulatory climate, notably on crypto and soon AI ‚Äî two non-linear technological breakthroughs that will likely determine tomorrow‚Äôs leading countries.

On foreign policy, the administration is exacerbating tensions with Russia through an aggressive NATO expansion narrative focused on Ukraine and prolonging an unwinnable war. This is costing American taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars, the world hundreds of thousands of lives, depleting the U.S. military arsenal and risking World War III. On Iran, this administration is continuing a misguided Obama-era plan to bring Iran closer to the West by unfreezing Trump-era sanctions, thus giving the Mollahs‚Äô regime the ability to fund terrorism and pursue its anti-America, anti-Israel, and anti-Jewish agenda. The withdrawal from Afghanistan was also handled disastrously. We‚Äôre leaving a door open for China to invade Taiwan by coming across as weak. Most importantly to me, concerning Israel, the administration is enabling Iran to fund Hamas and Hezbollah, restraining Israel in its fight against its enemies, thus prolonging another conflict, which is costing more lives on both sides and allowing unprecedented levels of antisemitism to rise at home.

I believe we need a President who is unequivocally pro: America, the Constitution, business, Bitcoin/crypto, innovation, Israel, small government, legal immigration, free speech, meritocracy, and common sense ‚Äî and anti: regulatory proliferation, illegal immigration, unjust wars, Iran‚Äôs current regime, and domestic groups that oppose American values. These issues are central to President Trump‚Äôs platform.

Naturally, I disagree with President Trump and the GOP on some issues, particularly women‚Äôs reproductive rights. While I‚Äôve come to learn that extreme views exist in both parties, I firmly believe that women should have the unalienable right to make their own decisions on this polarizing topic. President Trump confirmed he was against a national abortion ban and supported the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision on maintaining access to mifepristone, which was reassuring and a sign that the party was moving closer to the center.

It‚Äôs impossible to close this post without mentioning President Trump‚Äôs recent assassination attempt. The courage and resolve he displayed seconds after being hit by a bullet was awe-inspiring for his followers and detractors alike. This was a man, however imperfect, who, at that moment, incarnated the American spirit in the most vivid way, starting to bring a split nation together.

Some claim that reelecting President Trump will bring our democracy to its knees. However, the alternative ‚Äî having unelected individuals with this much power and no accountability run our government coupled with four more years of bad policies at home and abroad ‚Äî might present a more significant threat. Neither will likely change in a Harris administration and could potentially worsen.

In this pivotal moment, confronted with the choices we have, I am endorsing and supporting a return to a Republican administration in 2025.",2024-07-31 17:27:25+00:00

2. Undermines parental rights and the parent-child relationship.
3. Potentially puts children at risk by encouraging secret gender transitions without parental knowledge or support.
4. Ignores growing evidence and international trends cautioning against pediatric gender transitions.
5. Disregards public opinion, which largely supports parental notification in such cases.
6. May lead to political backlash against Democrats, as exemplified by the author's interview subject who switched party affiliation.

"The governor of America‚Äôs richest and most populous state yesterday doubled down on his new law, which requires that schools hide a psychiatric disorder known as gender dysphoria from parents.

California Governor Gavin Newsom claims his law ‚Äúprotects the child-parent relationship‚Äù and prevents the government from ‚Äúinappropriately intervening in family matters.‚Äù

This is disinformation. Newsom knows full well that his law prevents schools from telling parents when their children have come to believe that they are the opposite sex and were born into the wrong body.

This is dangerous because the next step is for doctors to give those children and adolescents puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and the final treatment, surgery.

Parents in California should know that Gavin Newsom has put their children in danger.

Why is Gavin Newsom doing this? Doesn‚Äôt he want to be president?

It‚Äôs true Gavin won‚Äôt ever be elected president now. Voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania won‚Äôt elect a president who enables such mistreatment.

So what‚Äôs driving him?

You may have heard the expression, ‚ÄúGood times create weak leaders.‚Äù This expression suggests that when things are going well, we elect politicians who aren‚Äôt capable of doing anything.

It‚Äôs rational when you think about it. When things are going good, you don‚Äôt want to change anything.

Gavin Newsom is the weak leader born from good times. He was born into a close relationship with the billionaire Getty oil family. He was spoiled as a boy and has never worked for anything other than to advance himself.

Gavin Newsom is such a weak leader that he caved into activist pressure he should have protected children.

The problem with weak leaders is that they create bad times. That‚Äôs what Gavin has done. He has increased homelessness by 40% in just four and a half years. He‚Äôs letting people with schizophrenia die from fentanyl overdoses and be sexually assaulted in tents on the sidewalks. And now he‚Äôs let activists prey on California‚Äôs children.

Instead of hospitalizing people psychotic from schizophrenia and meth, Gavin‚Äôs government is helping them smoke fentanyl and meth on the street and die. Instead of doing cognitive behavioral therapy with adolescents with gender dysphoria, anxiety, and depression, Gavin‚Äôs government is putting them on puberty blockers, giving them hormones, and performing surgeries.

Behind Gavin is a pathological desire to care for people. That means creating more sick people. Call it Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. This is what progressives are doing. They are affirming mental illnesses and psychiatric disorders rather than treating them. Think of the Kathy Bates character in ‚ÄúMisery.‚Äù

California is creating and affirming psychiatric disorders. The public health departments are funding and enabling drug addiction and homelessness. And the schools are promoting gender dysphoria.

The good news is that this reality is now visible for everyone to see. Elon Musk shared my video yesterday, and now 20 million people have viewed it. I have received requests from media all around the world, even in California, where publishers, editors, and journalists have championed Gavin Newsom‚Äôs destructive and inhumane policies for 30 years.

We are organizing a movement to fight back. Please add your name to our list of people working to Save California.

Gavin Newsom will never be president, and he won‚Äôt be governor for much longer, but it‚Äôs up to us to smash the pathocratic bureaucracy he created and replace it with one dedicated to caring for people, not mistreating them.

We need to fight back against California‚Äôs disinformation about what he‚Äôs done. Please sign up and subscribe to Public now.

Most of all, we need to get the word out that Gavin Newsom is lying about what he‚Äôs done. He‚Äôs not protecting the child-parent relationship, he‚Äôs weaponizing the government to attack it.

Change is coming. As the nation‚Äôs richest and most populous state, California has no excuse for its gross mistreatment of children, adolescents, and vulnerable adults.",2024-07-17 16:27:23+00:00

"I‚Äôm afraid I have some terrible news. The governor of America‚Äôs largest and richest state has just signed a law that puts 10 million children and adolescents in grave danger of medical mistreatment.

The media headlines have it wrong. They claim that California Governor Gavin Newsom‚Äôs new law protects children by stopping public schools from outing their new gender to their parents.

It does just the opposite. It makes children vulnerable to irreversible and lifelong medical abuse and mistreatment. And it is all based on the pseudoscientific idea that some children are born into the wrong bodies and that we can change a person‚Äôs sex through drugs and surgery.

For any of this to make sense, you have to understand what‚Äôs happening in Britain. Several years ago, the government appointed a well-respected pediatrician named Hillary Cass to investigate whether it was ethical to block the puberty of children, give them opposite-sex hormones, and perform surgeries on their bodies to make them feel better about their gender. Dr. Cass came back a few weeks ago and said no, absolutely not.

Around the same time, the British government banned puberty blockers nationwide. And, just a few days ago, the new Labor Party government affirmed that it would maintain the former government‚Äôs ban.

In her report, Cass said that the so-called ‚Äúsocial transition,‚Äù whereby a child adopts the identity of the opposite sex, is not a neutral act and has psychological consequences. This means it is the first step toward medical intervention.

What Gavin Newsom has done is actively prevented schools from informing parents that their children have been put on a medical pathway.

This is an outrageous attack on the rights of children and parents. Children have a right to go through puberty. No adult should be able to block their puberty. And parents have a right to know if their child thinks that they are the opposite sex or were born into the wrong body.

We have seen with leaked internal documents of the leading gender medicine group, WPATH, that these medical interventions, namely puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery, are not only irreversible but result in sterilization and loss of sexual function.

Children or adolescents are simply not mature enough to understand the effects of so-called ‚Äúgender-affirming care.‚Äù They cannot, in other words, give their informed consent.

The new law creates the grave risk that activist teachers, students, and outside groups will convince their children that they were born into the wrong body, and hide their ‚Äúsocial transition‚Äù from parents, which will lead to harmful medical mistreatment.

As such, the law that Newsom just signed is the opposite of what both children and their parents need. We need schools to immediately warn parents if their children think they are the opposite sex.

After all, this is a diagnosable psychiatric condition known as ‚Äúgender dysphoria.‚Äù And if your child has a psychiatric disorder, whether anxiety, depression, an eating disorder, or gender dysphoria, you have a right to know.

And schools must stop teaching children, or allowing other people to teach children, the pseudoscientific and dehumanizing ideas that it‚Äôs possible to be born into the wrong body and possible to change one‚Äôs sex.

As such, either the legislature, the courts, or a ballot initiative will be required to nullify Newsom‚Äôs law. Until then, it is important to spread the word to parents that California public schools are fundamentally unsafe for the millions of children who attend them.",2024-07-16 22:30:41+00:00

"I KNOW A HERO WHEN I SEE ONE

The Washington Post names me along with @elonmusk as one of several businessmen who are using their ‚Äúmegaphones‚Äù to spread ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù about the assassination attempt on President Trump. 

I‚Äôm not sure what ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù they‚Äôre referring to, but I know what I saw, and I know what the crowd in Butler witnessed live. 

At it turns out, my father-in-law lives in Pennsylvania and he was at the rally on Saturday. When the shots rang out and Trump went down, he said pandemonium broke out around him. Everyone feared the worst.¬†

But then Trump rose. Covered in his own blood, resisting the secret service‚Äôs efforts to whisk him away to safety, Trump raised his fist defiantly, and the crowd could see him say: ‚ÄúFight. Fight. Fight.‚Äù

Immediately the fear of the crowd dissipated, the chaotic uncertainty lifted, and it was replaced with steely resolve. The crowd responded back as one: ‚ÄúUSA, USA, USA!‚Äù¬†

This is not a ‚Äúnarrative.‚Äù It is the truth. Trump stood defiant in the face of an assassin‚Äôs bullet. There is no way to fake courage like that. 

It was more important for Trump to let the crowd know that he was unbowed and unbroken than to be taken to safety. 

Donald Trump has already been in the fight of his life for months, as vindictive Democrats seek to imprison him, but on this day he came within inches of losing it. He has risked everything for this country.¬†

"Musk: EU Wanted ""Illegal Secret Deal"" to ""Quietly Censor Speech""

the european commission wanted ùïè to hire a team of people in the eu that would unilaterally oversee the removal of 'misinformation' on the platform, a source with knowledge of the issue told us

On Friday, @elonmusk said the European Commission (EC) ""offered ùïè an illegal secret deal: if we quietly censored speech without telling anyone,"" they would not seek to issue daily fines related to ùïè‚Äôs blue check verification system that could total 6% of the company‚Äôs annual revenue.

""The other platforms accepted that deal. ùïè did not,"" his post says.

Elon‚Äôs post came after EC commissioner Thierry Breton announced the Commission's preliminary findings that pre-Elon, blue checkmarks ""used to mean trustworthy sources of information,"" but now violate the Digital Services Act because, today, ""anyone can subscribe to obtain such a 'verified' status,"" therefore the commission may ""impose fines & require significant changes.""

The EC wanted ùïè to hire a team of people in the EU that could number in the hundreds to remove 'misinformation' from the platform, a person with knowledge of the issue told PW Editor-in-Chief @micsolana. ùïè would have no recourse in these removal decisions, the person said.

""The objective of the Digital Services Act is to ensure a safe and fair online environment for European citizens that is respectful of their rights, in particular freedom of expression,"" EC spokesperson Thomas Regnier told Pirate Wires over email. ""The DSA requires a fair and transparent complaint mechanism for users. If an account is suspended, the user has the right to contest the decision. This means that decisions must not be arbitrary, and users are empowered to protect their online presence... When an account is restricted, the user must be informed and has the right to appeal the decision.""

Shortly after his post about the secret deal, Elon posted that he plans to take the Commission to court if its preliminary findings are confirmed and it pursues an enforcement action against ùïè.

The Digital Services Act (DSA) is a new legislative regulatory bundle by the EC that only became fully applicable this February, and seeks to fine companies like ùïè, Meta, and Google up to 6% of their annual revenue for violations, which include failure to remove ""illegal"" content once it‚Äôs reported. What‚Äôs considered illegal can vary depending on the specific national laws of EU member states, provided these laws are compatible with EU law. For example, content that‚Äôs illegal in Germany must be removed for users in Germany, even if it is not illegal in another member state.

The EC also accused ùïè of failure to ""comply with the required transparency on advertising, as it does not provide a searchable and reliable advertisement repository,"" and prohibiting ""eligible researchers from independently accessing its public data,"" both of which are in violation of its DSA.

In April, Elon publicly feuded with Brazilian lawmakers after he refused to comply with their demands to remove accounts without explanation to account owners or the public. Brazilian lawmakers had previously asked ùïè to remove accounts critical of its regime under these conditions.

""We do not know the reasons these blocking orders have been issued. We do not know which posts are alleged to violate the law. We are prohibited from saying which court or judge issued the order, or on what grounds. We are prohibited from saying which accounts are impacted. We are threatened with daily fines if we fail to comply,"" posted ùïè‚Äôs Global Government Affairs team about Brazil‚Äôs demands. ùïè ultimately reversed course, and announced it would comply with the Brazilian government‚Äôs requests.

Today, the EC's findings are ""preliminary,"" but per the EC, ""if the Commission's preliminary views were to be ultimately confirmed... [it] could entail fines of up to 6% of the total worldwide annual turnover of [ùïè], and order [it] to take measures to address the breach.""

"Watch Ben Shapiro Tear into Censorship Cartel in Fiery Congressional Testimony

‚ÄúWe're in the midst of a trust crisis in the world of media, which is because so many in the legacy media have lied in order to preserve left-leaning narratives. To take just the most recent example, we were told by the legacy media that President Biden was just fine. For years, anyone who questioned his health and mental fitness was trafficking in cheap fakes. And then President Biden went out and engaged in a full-scale mental collapse on stage in front of hundreds of millions of people.

‚ÄúSo we can see why Americans, at least Americans who are not Democrats, do not trust the media. The question isn't really why the legacy media have lost Americans' trust. We know that answer. The question is why, despite that loss of trust, the legacy media continue to gain share in the advertising market. And the answer is simple. There is, in fact, an informal pressure system created by Democratic legislators, this White House, legacy media, advertisers, and pseudo-objective brand safety organizations. That system guarantees that advertising dollars flow only to left-wing media brands.

‚ÄúLet me explain how this works. When a conservative competitor to the legacy media arises, members of that legacy media and their political allies rush to paint such competitors as dangerous. The commentator Kara Swisher of the New York Times, for example, told the head of YouTube that my videos at Daily Wire were a gateway drug that would lead children, including her own teenage son, to watch neo-Nazi content. Nevermind the yarmulke.

‚ÄúElected Democrats pick up that same messaging. In 2017, Senator Dianne Feinstein told lawyers at Facebook, Google, and Twitter, ‚ÄòYou created these platforms and now they‚Äôre being misused, and you have to be the ones to do something about it, or we will.‚Äô Social media companies react to incentive structures, including threats. They have responded by adopting the standards of third-party, left-wing informational safety groups like the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, or GARM. GARM purportedly sets brand safety standards, objective standards by which advertisers and platforms can supposedly determine just what sort of content ought to be deemed safe for advertising.

‚ÄúIn reality, GARM acts as a cartel. Its members account for 90% of ad spending in the United States, almost a trillion dollars. In other words, if you're not getting ad dollars from GARM members, it's nearly impossible to run an ad-based business. And if you're not following their preferred political narratives, the ones that Kara Swisher and Dianne Feinstein would follow, you will not be deemed brand safe. Your business will be throttled. We at Daily Wire have experienced this firsthand. In 2017, after Senator Feinstein made her threats to bring the weight of government down on social media platforms, the Daily Wire YouTube channel saw a 1000% increase in content enforcements over a two-year period. Since 2021, after Democrat officials further turned up the heat on social media companies, my personal Facebook page has seen an over 80% drop in impressions.

‚ÄúOr take Joe Rogan. When Joe said that he had taken Ivermectin after getting COVID, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki pressured Spotify to take action, stating, ‚ÄòWe want every platform to be doing more to call out missing disinformation while also uplifting accurate information.‚Äô Spotify complied. Spotify, of course, works with GARM.

‚ÄúSo what are the brand safety standards that GARM uses? The standards begin with inarguable things that we've heard from the other witnesses, like preventing the distribution of child sexual abuse material or stopping terrorism. But GARM doesn't draw the line at what is criminal, abusive, or dangerous. Their standards also include restrictions on hate speech, harassment, misinformation, or, my personal favorite, insensitive, irresponsible, and harmful treatment of debated, sensitive social issues. Those criteria are highly subjective in theory, and they are purely partisan in practice. For example, last year, Daily Wire host Matt Walsh was fully demonetized on YouTube, a GARM member. Why? For quote-unquote misgendering, which to GARM is to say that men are not women. Perfectly obvious facts now run afoul of GARM's censorship standards.

‚ÄúCompanies targeted by GARM, like the Daily Wire, Breitbart, Fox News, and so many others, reach hundreds of millions of people with opinions and beliefs long established as within the mainstream of American conservative thought. GARM and its members have no respect for the beliefs of those people. They would like them marginalized or squashed. It's time to stand up for the First Amendment in this Congress.

‚ÄúCongress can do so in two ways. First, Congress must investigate the informal and perhaps formal arrangements between censorship cartels like GARM and executive branch agencies. The Daily Wire has already filed a federal lawsuit against the State Department for allegedly doing just this. Second, Congress can itself stop engaging in violation of free speech principles. Two weeks ago, writing a dissent in Murthy versus Missouri, Justice Alito condemned what he called sophisticated and coercive government campaigns against free speech.

‚ÄúMembers of this committee have engaged in precisely such campaigns. When Congressman Schiff speaks about targeting social media companies that must be, quote, ‚Äòpulled and dragged into this era of corporate responsibility because they are too tolerant of misinformation,‚Äô he knows what he is doing. He is participating in a sophisticated, coercive campaign against free speech. When Congresswoman Jayapal blames social media for placing America at the precipice of a democratic crisis and calls on them to target what they deem hate groups, she also knows what she is doing. She is participating in a sophisticated, coercive campaign against free speech. When Congressman Hank Johnson says, quote, ‚ÄòWe need a constitutional amendment to allow the legislature to control the so-called free speech rights of corporations,‚Äô he also knows what he is doing.

‚ÄúWe all know what these government actors, what some people in this room are doing. You're using the tacit threat of government action to compel private companies to throttle viewpoints you don't particularly like. The First Amendment was not designed to enable workarounds by elected officials. It was directed at Congress, at you. And you're abdicating your fundamental duty when you exert pressure on private companies to censor speech. Some in this room have been doing just that for years. We in the non-legacy media have been feeling the effects. In the name of the Constitution and the name of democracy, this should stop.‚Äù

"What‚Äôs worse, this story is super misleading!
 
In one instance it claims, ‚Äúthree years of data collected by the Coastal Bend group near the SpaceX site indicated a 54 percent decline in the threatened piping plover population through 2021.‚Äù
 
This is false. The frequently cited study conducted by Newstead and Hill (2021) is outdated and unreliable for describing potential piping plover population trends over time.

The 2021 study did not consistently perform field visits during the same time of year. In some years, surveys included periods when piping plovers were actively migrating and in other years surveys only included months when winter residents were likely to be present. They also did not always check both kinds of habitat that are present during each survey.
 
Point being, the piping plover population being sampled was inconsistent across years. This is important because the occurrence of piping plovers at any given location at any given time is highly variable. Presence or absence may be due to a wide variety of factors unrelated to changes to the population size; birds may simply be someplace else. And, the more times they looked for piping plovers in a year, the higher their population estimate was.
 
It's also important to understand piping plovers do not nest in Texas. With very few exceptions, piping plovers observed in Texas are either migrating to or from wintering areas further south along the Mexico Gulf Coast or in the Caribbean, or reside in the vicinity over winter. Piping plovers tend to return to the same wintering areas year after year, even when conditions at those wintering areas change due to extreme weather or human-caused disturbance.
 
Now here‚Äôs the kicker: In response to questions about the reliability of their study, Newstead and Hill reanalyzed their data and published a follow-up report (2022) which found no significant change in population abundance of piping plovers at Boca Chica over time. A decreasing trend in abundance over the first three years of the study was balanced by an increase in the final year of the study (once data from additional survey visits was added to the analysis).

For our part, we have conducted nine years of monitoring using a protocol developed with US Fish and Wildlife Services, and for the past two years we have ensured consistent sampling throughout the year by surveying monthly. The findings show little to no strong evidence of trends, either increasing or decreasing, for any of the target species, including piping plovers.",2024-07-10 19:31:09+00:00

"I've said this before but it's worth repeating:  World history is defined by the following simple rule.  There are two groups on either side of a river.  Each covets various resources from the other group.  The only thing that stops a perpetual conflict between the two groups is the realization by each group that the other will respond in equal measure (or worse) if attacked.  Now imagine that the West has decided to throw away this defining dynamic that shapes this fundamental historical reality.  Defending what is ours is rooted in our genes; it is a central feature of our human nature.  But the West has said that we are so progressive, so empathetic, so enligteneed that we are not bound by pediastrian biology.  Hence, we will not defend our culture; we will not defend our heritage; we will not defend our religion; we will not defend our women; we will not defend our children; we will not defend our values.  According to our Western leaders, only barbarians worry about such defensive concerns.  We are open, tolerant, kind, compassionate, welcoming.  No amount of evidence can convince us that other groups might do us harm.  And hence, we brainwash our children who become our politicians; we rejoice in the rape of our societies because this proves that we are kind.  It is a mixture of what I discussed in The Parasitic Mind and what I'll be presenting to the world in my next book Suicidal Empathy.  I frankly am running out of optimism; I'm bereft of hope.

"The District Attorney race in Travis County/Greater Austin is among the most important this cycle. Everyone able should vote by March 5th. Watch this video and read the following to understand why ‚Äì and share with others.

I don‚Äôt like to get directly involved in politics, and prefer to stick to building social enterprises that bring people together (i.e., @KINDSnacks, Builders, @eatsomos, @EmpaticoOrg ), but the stakes are so high for Austin that I feel the need to share some facts:

Austin is facing a rampant rise in crime. All the data demonstrates it. And all of Jose Garza‚Äôs policies point to it.

Some specific examples:

‚Ä¢ Garza let Santos Celso-Flores, who was awaiting trial for participating in the gang rape of 13-year-old girl, out on a $40 bond. While out on bond, Celso-Flores molested two more young girls.

‚Ä¢ Hilario Adrian‚Äôs bond was lowered to just $1 after Garza failed to bring his aggravated assault case to a grand jury in time. Shortly after his release, he brutally attacked an innocent bystander in downtown Austin, stabbing him to death.

‚Ä¢ Richard Williams brutally raped his ex-girlfriend at knifepoint for two hours while strangling and beating her. Garza cut a deferred adjudication plea deal with Williams, meaning he was released after just 90 days in prison without anything on his record.

‚Ä¢ Garza released Dedreuain Reese, who had been charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for pistol-whipping a woman, on a personal recognizance bond. Just weeks after he was released on bond, Reese committed a murder at the same house where he pistol whipped the woman.

Friends have been telling me about the rise in crime in Austin. A family who lived downtown had their home burglarized. Another was held up. A friend who leads the Public Safety Commission shared the above examples. I assumed these were isolated cases and initially dismissed the issue. Eventually I did dozens of hours of research.

The data is staggering: https://t.co/y4Cfgp8O2m

‚Ä¢ 127% increase in the murder rate since Garza took over!
‚Ä¢ Car jackings more than doubled!
‚Ä¢ Convictions are down 61%!
‚Ä¢ Zero Jury Trials by Garza since he took over as DA!

How is Garza responsible for this? Some examples:

‚Ä¢ When he took office, Garza abolished the DA division that sorted out cases. As a result, today there are over seven thousand unindicted felony crimes! ¬†Not 7. Not 70. Not 700. Seven THOUSAND pending cases that the DA‚Äôs office has failed to process.

‚Ä¢ In 2021, Garza released a bail reform plan that explicitly included releasing people on bail for just $1. Since then, Travis County has been plagued by crimes committed by people out on bonds.

‚Ä¢ Over 75 (out of a professional staff of around 95) experienced prosecutors have left the DA's Office since Garza took over in 2021. He has hired inexperienced and untested lawyers to handle the most serious and complicated cases in Travis County.

‚Ä¢ Here is testimony from a Mother whose children were sexually assaulted: https://t.co/kMYtDMztXD

These are not theoretical issues. And the people they affect are the most vulnerable members of our society.

‚Ä¢ Lynn Isaak survived a brutal attack while running in Travis Heights. ¬†She solved her own case through Nextdoor, trusted the DA's Office with the prosecution, and was then shocked when her attacker got probation with no jail time and no electronic monitoring. https://t.co/4fmB5ZK9xR

‚Ä¢ Lashonda Lemons was beaten so badly by her partner that she lost her baby. The DA's Office got the case and lowered the charge from aggravated assault to a lesser offense and gave him deferred adjudication - a punishment that allows the offender to walk away without a conviction. This was all done over Lemons' objection.

There is hope on the horizon: Jeremy Sylestine is a lifelong Democrat running in the Democratic Primary for Travis District Attorney. He is Native American member of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas. He went to UT, served as a Public Defender, and then for 15 years as a highly respected member of the DA‚Äôs office in Travis County. Meet Jeremy: https://t.co/TBXmrVbzj1

He is among the highest integrity people you can meet. He is sacrificing a very good job and risking a lot for the sake of Austin and Travis County.

Jeremy is compassionate, but he understands the duty to protect the most vulnerable members of our community from violent criminals. It‚Äôs quite a contrast: https://t.co/rHkeWthWmf

It took me months to understand why, in contrast, Jose Garza would allow a violent criminal who drugged and raped a 13 year old girl to get off without anything on his record. Why would he plea down everything to misdemeanor, including when a violent felon beat his pregnant girlfriend so brutally that she lost her baby?

Even the most kindhearted also want justice and public safety.

But Garza has a radical ideology that ANY prosecution ever is evil. When he was a public defender, that position was acceptable. But as DA in charge of enforcing the law, he is subverting his duties and violating his oath.

Under Garza‚Äôs simplistic ideology, everyone is a victim or an oppressor based on their background and position in society rather than based on their actions and behavior.
For Garza, the criminals that commit violent crimes are the victims so even if they committed rape or murder they cannot be at fault. It‚Äôs the system‚Äôs fault.
For Garza, the DA‚Äôs office he presides over is the oppressor and so he is slowly dismantling it (not just reform it, but dismantling it, which is why he disbanded the division that processes cases, resulting in over seven thousand unindicted criminal felonies thus far).
It‚Äôs so extreme it‚Äôs illogical. But that is what radical extremism does.

In terms of financial backing, virtually all support for Jeremy comes from people that live in Travis County. Garza came into power with $1 million from out of state money. The people that put Garza in power do not need to live with the consequences of his actions.

Jeremy‚Äôs supporters are locals whose families and loved ones live in Travis County. Our only agenda is to protect the community. For us teachers, entrepreneurs and parents it‚Äôs uncomfortable to get drawn into politically divisive issues. But the stakes are so high that everyone is stepping in.

It‚Äôs very unusual for other elected politicians to stand up against an incumbent from their party. ¬†The amount of Democratic leaders that I‚Äôve met and have told me how much they dislike Garza but can‚Äôt speak up is stunning.
And even then, you have icons of the Democratic establishment speaking up:

‚Ä¢ David Butts and Alfred Stanley are among the most highly respected Austinites and life-long liberals helping Jeremy‚Äôs campaign.

‚Ä¢ Former Austin City Councilwoman Ora Houston, former Travis County Commissioner Karen Huber, as well as the Austin Bar Association Preference Poll, the South Asian Bar Association of Austin, and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas have all endorsed Jeremy.

‚Ä¢ Even former State Senator Gonzalo Barrientos & Travis County Commissioner Margaret Gomez, fellow Hispanics, are so shocked by Jose Garza‚Äôs actions and so impressed with Jeremy‚Äôs integrity that they have endorsed Jeremy Sylestine.

Extremism seems to be taking over our country. ¬†But the proper response to rigidity and dehumanization from one side is not denial of facts and ‚Äúus vs them‚Äù dehumanization from the opposite extreme.

Personally, I identify as independent because I find political parties hyperpartisan. I support moderate candidates on both sides.

It‚Äôs high time for builders to transcend these labels and all join together.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are Democrat or Independent or Republican.

You are a human being. You are a citizen. When it comes to public safety, it‚Äôs not about politics.Your children should be able to walk downtown without fear for their safety. Your spouse should be able to go for a run in the park without fear of being assaulted or raped. It‚Äôs about enforcing the law to protect victims while showing compassion wherever justice guides us to. It‚Äôs about all of us being together to BUILD a better community for all.¬†

Everyone in Travis County should go out and vote for Jeremy - not just to keep our community safe - but to break the shackles of extremism from either side and show that the people in Austin are ONE and refuse to play divisive games from extremist ideological politicians from either side.

Regardless of political affiliation, anyone in #TravisCounty / Greater #AustinTx can go into a voting location, request a #DemocraticPrimary Ballot, and vote for #JeremySylestine in the most consequential election to the community.

- $250,000 in annual management fees
- $1.5 million for the first $50 million handed out

".@JoeRogan talks about the migrants in New York City beating cops, getting released without bail, and flipping off the cameras as they leave.

He points out that the city provides luxury hotels and free meals to illegal immigrants while many Americans face financial difficulties.

Rogan also brings up Intro 1867, known as the ‚ÄúOur City, Our Vote‚Äù law, approved by the New York City Council in December 2021.

This law would allow approximately 800,000 non-U.S. citizens with green cards and temporary work visas to vote in the city's municipal elections.

Mayor Eric Adams allowed it to become law on January 9, 2022.

A group of Republican voters and officials filed a lawsuit on January 10, 2023, arguing that letting over 800,000 non-U.S. citizens vote would dilute the votes of legitimate U.S. citizens.

On June 27, 2022, the New York State Supreme Court for Staten Island overturned the law, stating it violated the state's constitution.

Mayor Adams and the City Council appealed to a higher court, and the case has been stuck in court ever since.

Meanwhile, President Biden is fast-tracking work authorizations for non-U.S. citizens, potentially giving them the right to vote if Mayor Adams succeeds in the appeal.

Mayor Adams has a chance at winning.

As of June 2023, more than a dozen communities across the U.S., including Washington, DC, and municipalities in California, Maryland, and Vermont, allow noncitizens to vote in local elections.

Vermont‚Äôs top court supported noncitizen voting in municipal elections despite restrictions in the state constitution.

In Connecticut, Democrats aim to amend the state‚Äôs constitution to permit noncitizens to vote in local elections.

In December, the Boston City Council approved a proposal allowing noncitizens with ""legal status"" to vote in local elections.

Rogan points out that Democrats want to permanently change the voting demographics in the United States by importing as many votes as possible.

However, he finds it crazy to allow millions of illegal immigrants to enter the country each year, especially considering the increase in the number of terrorists caught at the southern border over the years:

"NEW - Former President of City Council of Atlantic City charged with submitting fraudulent mail-in ballots.

A criminal complaint accuses Craig Callaway, 64, a political organizer, of illegally obtaining and casting ballots that were counted in the November 2022 election.

About a month before the election, Callaway and others allegedly paid several individuals to carry completed Vote-By-Mail applications to the county clerk's office.

Once these individuals received the fraudulent mail-in ballots, they reportedly handed them over to Callaway and his associates.

Many of the mail-in ballots collected in this manner were allegedly cast using the names of individuals who have since confirmed that they did not vote in the November 2022 election.

Moreover, these individuals have stated that they did not give authorization for Callaway, his associates, or anyone else to vote on their behalf.

The criminal complaint discloses that a significant number of these fraudulent mail-in ballots were officially counted in the November 2022 election.

"Today is an important day for me--I am filing a lawsuit against @lucasfilm & @Disney
¬†
After my 20 years of building a career from scratch, and during the regime of former Disney CEO Bob Chapek, Lucasfilm made this statement on Twitter, terminating me from The Mandalorian: ‚ÄúGina Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm & there are no plans for her to be in the future. Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural & religious identities are abhorrent & unacceptable.‚Äù
¬†
Nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is I was being hunted down from everything I posted to every post I liked because I was not in line with the acceptable narrative of the time. My words were consistently twisted to demonize & dehumanize me as an alt right wing extremist. It was a bullying smear campaign aimed at silencing, destroying & making an example out of me.¬†
¬†
The thing is I never even used aggressive language. I shared thought provoking quotes, pictures, memes & occasionally I used my own words, not with aggression but with respect & the occasional comedy to keep the mood light in dark times.
¬†
Look with your own eyes at what I posted and ask yourself, for example, where did I compare Republicans to the Jewish people in the holocaust? I didn‚Äôt. Ask yourself why they were calling me a racist, was there any merit behind that or history of it whatsoever? ¬†No. Look at why I was called a transphobe--for making droid noises from Star Wars? ‚ÄúBeep, bop, boop‚Äù was obviously directed to the online bullies and did not in any way denigrate transgender people.¬†
¬†
Were my questions about masks, lockdowns & forced vaccines ok to ask & push the subject into the light? Should we have been allowed to publicly discuss those topics at that time without being harassed or censored? Absolutely.
¬†
Hollywood says they support female representation & equal rights. Why then were my male co-stars permitted to speak without harassment & re-education courses or termination, but I was not afforded the same right to exercise my freedom of speech.
¬†
Artists do not sign away our rights as American citizens when we enter into employment. I have spoken to all my co-stars since I was fired & there is nothing but care and kind words between us. I respect their right to free speech & do not have to think the same on every issue to be their friends & work with them & I know they feel the same towards me.
¬†
A couple months ago @ElonMusk tweeted that if you had been fired from using the platform (X) for exercising your right to free speech, he would like to offer these people legal representation. Quite the noble offer, but never in my wildest dreams would I have thought anyone would take on my case against Lucasfilm/Disney. ¬†Still, I did respond back ‚ÄúI think I qualify‚Äù & thousands of people agreed--but I did not expect anything.¬†
¬†
To my surprise, a few months ago I received an email from a lawyer who had been hired by X to look into my story & many others. Turns out after sending them as much information as I could gather these past few months, my now lawyers & X believe whole-heartedly in my case & are moving forward.
¬†
I would like to express my deepest gratitude & thank you to @ElonMusk & @X for giving me an opportunity to bring my case to light.
¬†
As for me, I would love to pick up where I left off & continue my journey of creating & participating in story-telling, which is¬†my utmost passion & everything I worked so hard for. It has been difficult to move forward with the lies & labels stuck on me, backed & encouraged by the most powerful entertainment company in the world. ¬†I am grateful someone has come to my defense in such a powerful way & look forward to clearing my name.¬†
¬†
Thank you to all the people who have supported me & made your voices heard. I pray God blesses each & every one of you.¬†

With love,

"Ten months ago, we launched the Vesuvius Challenge to solve the ancient problem of the Herculaneum Papyri, a library of scrolls that were flash-fried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.

Today we are overjoyed to announce that our crazy project has succeeded. After 2000 years, we can finally read the scrolls:
This image was produced by @Youssef_M_Nader, @LukeFarritor, and @JuliSchillij, who have now won the Vesuvius Challenge Grand Prize of $700,000. Congratulations!!

These fifteen columns come from the very end of the first scroll we have been able to read and contain new text from the ancient world that has never been seen before. The author ‚Äì probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus ‚Äì writes here about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures. In the closing section, he throws shade at unnamed ideological adversaries ‚Äì perhaps the stoics? ‚Äì¬†who ""have nothing to say about pleasure, either in general or in particular.""

This year, the Vesuvius Challenge continues. The text that we revealed so far represents just 5% of one scroll.

In 2024, our goal is to from reading a few passages of text to entire scrolls, and we're announcing a new $100,000 grand prize for the first team that is able to read at least 90% of all four scrolls that we have scanned.

The scrolls stored in Naples that remain to be read represent more than 16 megabytes of ancient text. But the villa where the scrolls were found was only partially excavated, and scholars tell us that there may be thousands more scrolls underground. Our hope is that the success of the Vesuvius Challenge catalyzes the excavation of the villa, that the main library is discovered, and that whatever we find there rewrites history and inspires all of us.

It's been a great joy to work on this strange and amazing project. Thanks to Brent Seales for laying the foundation for this work over so many years, thanks to the friends and Twitter users whose donations powered our effort, and thanks to the many contestants whose contributions have made the Vesuvius Challenge successful!

"üö®NEW - House Speaker Mike Johnson delivers first floor speech on border catastrophe, accusing President Biden of intentionally creating a ""clear and present danger to our national security.""

""Since I was elected Speaker less than 100 days ago, more than 700,000 illegals have been welcomed into our country illegally by the Biden administration.

American schoolchildren have been forced into virtual schools so migrants can sleep in their school buildings.

Korean War veterans have been booted from nursing homes that were sold to house migrants.

Our streets are being flooded with fentanyl. Hundreds of thousands of children and adults are being poisoned and losing their lives. Vulnerable children and women are being exploited and trafficked by cartels.

Since President Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas assumed office, there have been more than 7 million encounters with illegal aliens just at our southern border alone.

35 of our 50 states, including my home state of Louisiana, don't have a population that large.

More than 300 individuals who are on our terror watchlist have been apprehended on the southern border.

The frightening question is, how many have entered undetected?

We know there are at least 1.8 million gotaways that have escaped.

Understand that the situation at our border presents a clear and present danger to our national security, and it demands that it be addressed.

FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Homeland Security Committee in November that these gotaways are a great concern for the agency, and all 56 of our Joint Terrorism Task Forces are trying to identify who these people are.

We don't know how many terrorists are inside our borders.

We do know that fentanyl is pouring into our communities like an open sewer. 

Right now, the leading cause of death of death in America for Americans aged 18 to 46 is fentanyl poisoning.

To make matters worse, we've learned that the Biden administration is now simply just releasing 85% of the illegals who come across that border right into the country.

For reference, by the way, in 2013, the Obama administration detained 82% of illegal aliens. How do we go from detaining 82% to releasing 85%? 

It only happens if this is by design. It only happens if it's an orchestrated intentional effort by the administration to do exactly that, and that is what the evidence shows.

Earlier this month, I released a memo documenting 64 specific actions that the Biden administration has taken to undermine our border security and to promote the mass release of illegals and dangerous persons into our country.

The very first day President Biden walked into the Oval Office, he revoked Executive Order 9844. Do you know what that did? 

It ended the construction of the border wall that Congress had already paid for. Everybody has seen the images of the materials out there rotting in the sun. Why? 

Because Joe Biden decided unilaterally that he didn't want a wall. 

In February 2021, the administration stopped applying Title 42 expulsions to children and incentivize by doing that incentivize families to send unaccompanied children through Mexico under the watch of cartels and traffickers.

Since then, the administration admits to losing track of more than 80,000 unaccompanied children somewhere in the US.

We don't know where they are. Have they been put into trafficking rings? We know that some of these kids are being trafficked for free labor and being forced to do things that are too appalling for us to articulate on this floor. 

Everybody here knows that's happening, and we're not demanding the President stop it? He can. He has the power to do it.

In October 2021, the Biden administration revoked the migrant protection protocols that had been instituted under President Trump.

That's the policy that we all know colloquially as Remain in Mexico. The Remain in Mexico policy kept asylum seekers in a safe haven third country while they were seeking asylum in the United States.

Do you know why that works magically so well? Because it sent a message around the world that you shouldn't pay your life savings to a cartel to traffic you through Mexico and drop you over the US border because you're not going to be dropped over the US border. 

The word goes out on social media to countries all around the world. They are not going to let you in. 

Man, is that the most common sense rule you've ever thought of? President Biden doesn't agree because he stopped it. He issued an executive order to stop that common sense rule.

A senior border patrol officer told us on that trip to Eagle Pass that if President Biden, by the stroke of a pen, would issue an executive order today to just simply reinstate Remain in Mexico, they think that would stop the flow by 70%. 

One stroke of the pen by the President. He does not seem to care.

I told President Biden this myself on multiple occasions, most recently, a couple of weeks ago on the phone, I read him the law that says that he has all this authority, but he refuses to act. 

And even that's even despite court orders, by the way that instructed the administration to reinstate the institute remain in Mexico while the litigation was going on. You know what they did? They ignored it.

The Biden administration is actively incentivizing illegals to come to the United States. We have laid out the welcome mat. We told everybody around the world, come on, you know what? The US taxpayer will take care of you.

It's costing the American people billions and billions and billions of dollars to provide for people who are intentionally breaking our laws, billions and billions of dollars to house them and educate them and clothe them and take care of them. Why should we bear the burden when they break our laws?

In January 2023, the Biden administration expanded the use of the Customs and Border Patrol One App so illegal aliens could just make appointments and then be released immediately right into America's interior.

Guess what? 95% of all illegals who simply scheduled appointments through the app were released right into the United States. That's right. 

All you have to do is just download the app because they all have smartphones, make an appointment, and the President of the United States will release you into a network of NGOs who will put you on a plane to the destination of your choice. 

Without identification, by the way, while Americans are waiting in line to get through TSA. All on the dime of the American taxpayer.

In December 2023, CBP recorded more than 302,000 encounters, almost double the population of my hometown of Shreveport, Louisiana. In just one month 302,000 people just walked right into the country.

I could go on and on about the 64 actions we've documented that President Biden has specifically taken to open our border wide up, but it's crystal clear his policy choices and Secretary Mayorkas refusal to comply with the law are driving this border catastrophe.

They have chosen disorder and chaos for us rather than securing the homeland. They've ceded the homeland to cartels and traffickers. 

In the Del Rio sector alone in Eagle Pass, Texas, the cartels are making an estimated $3.5 million dollars a day trafficking human beings into our country. Do the math. 

They are making billions of dollars a year trafficking undocumented children and victims into this country. 

The Department of Homeland Security has effectively become a taxi driver to just help traffickers complete the last few miles of their human smuggling operation, and they're making billions of dollars in the process. 

It's absolute madness, and it is dismantling the safety of our communities. More than half a million known criminals and illegal aliens are in the US in our communities, free to re-offend and victimize American people.

When we were at Eagle Pass in the Del Rio sector earlier in January, they told us that 60 to 70% of the people coming across the border right there at that epicenter are single adult males. They're military-aged.

These are not huddled masses of families seeking refuge and asylum. These are people coming into our country to do only God knows what. 

The Biden administration is allowing it, and we've noted that they are coming from adversarial nations and from terrorist regions. We have no idea what they're planning. 

But in fiscal year 2023, border patrol encountered illegals from 170 different countries, including hundreds from Iran and Syria, thousands from Russia, and tens of thousands have come in from China. Tell me that's not dangerous?

Law enforcement and intelligence leaders are warning us that we may very well suffer a preventable terrorist attack here in the homeland if we don't immediately secure that border and remove these dangerous terrorists from inside our borders.

I read the black letter law to the President of the United States on the phone about two and a half weeks ago. I said, Mr. President, it says very clearly that you have all the tools and the executive authority necessary to reverse the catastrophe that you have created. He has those tools right now, and he has since day one.

We have to decide if we believe in the rule of law or not. We have to decide if we're a sovereign nation or we're not. I believe that border security is part of our solemn obligation to safeguard the well-being of our citizens and uphold the principles that define who we are as a nation.

A weak border weakens America, and a strong border is good for America, and a stronger America is good for everybody around the world. And everybody in this chamber should acknowledge that. 

Just as we lock our doors at night to protect our homes, we secure our borders to protect our homeland. And my friends, that is our sacred obligation.""

"Judge Kathaleen McCormick rescinded Elon Musk's $55 billion Tesla compensation package, overturning the company's board and 80% of its shareholders.

McCormick also ruled against @elonmusk during his Twitter acquisition.

Before becoming the head of the Delaware Chancery Court, McCormick worked at a Delaware law firm called Young Conaway.

This firm and its employees have been major donors to President Joe Biden for decades.

In 2016, Hunter Biden hosted a gubernatorial campaign event for Congressman John Carney, with then-Vice President Joe Biden as the guest speaker.

This event took place at the Law Offices of Young Conaway in Wilmington, Delaware.

Carney, a close friend of Joe Biden for the last four decades, later became governor and nominated Kathaleen McCormick, a partner at Young Conaway, to her position on the Delaware Chancery Court.

In a March 2018 email, Hunter Biden claimed to personally know every judge on the Delaware Chancery Court while threatening legal action against his Chinese business partners.

""I will bring the suit in the Chancery court in Delaware - which as you know is my home state and I am privileged to have worked with and know every judge on the chancery court.""

After Elon Musk purchased Twitter with the stated goal of restoring free-speech, President Biden called for a federal investigation into Musk on the podium at the White House.

Following this, the Biden Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Federal Trade Commission initiated legal actions and investigations against Tesla, SpaceX, and X.

This recent decision by Judge McCormick, who worked with Biden's top donors and was nominated by Biden's close friend, to override Tesla's board and the majority of its shareholders is another clear example of the Biden administration and its allies weaponizing the American legal system against their political opponents.",2024-02-01 08:09:39+00:00

On President Biden's inaugural day, he introduced policies that incentivize illegal immigration:

‚Ä¢ Paused Deportations
‚Ä¢ Suspended ""Remain in Mexico""
‚Ä¢ Stopped Border Wall Construction

Since Biden's policy changes, over 8 million people have illegally entered the country, with millions more slipping past border patrol undetected.

This surge in illegal immigration is a national security crisis, costing American taxpayers hundreds of billions per year.

Major U.S. cities, grappling with the escalating financial burden, are slashing budgets for essential services such as fire, police, and education.

President Biden holds the power to halt this crisis that is draining America's resources and endangering its citizens.

The solution is as simple as the actions that led to this crisis‚ÄîBiden should use his pen to reverse his executive orders.

""No great nation can be in a position where they can't control their borders. It matters how you control your borders. Not just for immigration, but it matters for drugs, terror, and a whole range of things.""

""We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently, and lawfully to become immigrants in this country.""

‚Äî Barack Obama

""All Americans, not only in the States most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use imposes burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, and by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.""

"Surely you cannot be this obtuse. I hope your ignorance is feigned and not sincere.

In all 50 states in America ‚Äî as a result of preposterous judicial rulings ‚Äî illegal aliens and millions of other ineligible noncitizens ‚Äî can register to vote merely by checking a box on a federal form declaring that they are citizens. 

This attestation is not validated or verified in any way prior to voting, nor inspected or checked in any way subsequent to voting. It functions entirely on the honor system.

We are expecting the same people who dishonored our sovereign border to honor the integrity of a piece of paper.

In other words, we are to believe that millions of people who have collectively violated the law millions of times (illegal entry, smuggling, harboring, illegal overstay, social security fraud, identity theft, illegal work, failure to pay taxes, etc.) will not check a mere box on a form because that too is illegal! (Knowing full well their assertion will be accepted without any further scrutiny whatsoever).

We are truly the first society in all history with a completely open border combined with no citizenship verification for voting. (Not to mention the ability to vote remotely via mail or drop box for weeks at a time or, in several states, third party collection of mail ballots).

I stumbled on a flea market on the road to Eagle Pass and met a rancher and his wife selling tools and antique jewelry. He warned me of the dangers posed by Venezuelan immigrants, who would ""Axe you to death with a machete.""

Intrigued, I grabbed his $10 sledgehammer and playfully swung it, prompting him to clarify that the ""sweet ones"" cross at the border bridge where they are welcomed, while the dangerous ones sneak through his ranch, cutting fences, leaving trash. 

The rancher was serious when he told me, ‚Äúsoon you‚Äôll have to open your home to illegal immigrants.‚Äù

With a newfound sense of caution and a touch of dark humor, I continued my journey to the southern border.

Texas Born: Gas Station Encounter

At a La Pryor gas station, bold letters proclaimed ""TXB: WE ARE TEXAS BORN."" 
While there, I spotted a van full of illegal migrants, with the driver inside buying snacks.

Many Latino business owners proudly emphasize their Texas roots.

Chilly Sunday at the Secure Camino Real International Bridge, Eagle Pass

Sunday morning was a brisk 42-degrees. I arrived early at the same bridge Elon Musk once streamed from. Things were well-staffed for a Sunday morning.
A formidable force of US Border Patrol, Texas National Guard, and Texas Dept. of Public Safety personnel was hard at work.
Truckloads of supplies (food, water, Pampers) and portable facilities were present, with Texas BBQ smoker grills standing nearby.

Secure Location but not for legal citizens; I was kicked out.

As I explored the area, armored personnel directed me to leave and suggested the media area or the nearby golf course. ‚ÄúGet back in your Tesla, and leave!‚Äù 

I drove my Tesla to the media area. 
I admit I was impressed by their awareness of the Tesla brand.

The irony of the situation was not lost on me: the area was secured only for illegal immigrants.

At 9:30 am, I witnessed US Border Patrol welcoming two illegal immigrants, who were driven off in a van. Stray dogs roamed between the immigrants and me, initially growling at me but eventually quieting down.

Later, I met a Fox News crew at the media area. The livestream operator pointed out a group of illegal immigrants approaching US Border Patrol. The crew advised me to return to my hotel and come back later, as it was too cold for many immigrants to cross.

Bathrooms for the Illegal but not for the Legal

Despite the unwelcoming atmosphere, I remained in the Media Area until 11:30 am. 

At 11:40 am, I was informed that I couldn't use the porta potties because they were reserved for the migrants. Again, irony. If I needed to take a sh*t, it would have to be in the bushes.

Millions Blown on Illegal Immigrant Welcome Party!

Eagle Pass felt like a waste of our tax dollars, our hard earned resources. A fully staffed ‚Äúwelcome party‚Äù was just there for one purpose, the welcoming of illegal immigrants.

11:42 am - A jumbo bus and two smaller vans rolled up, ready to shuttle illegal immigrants away. From the golf course, I caught the scene on video, thinking, ""Okay, that's a ton of cash to be throwing around!""

2:15 pm - I bid adieu to the Fox team and the massive crew of US Border Patrol, Texas National Guard, and Texas Dept. of Public Safety personnel. They were still there, probably wondering how the heck they got stuck with this gig.

3:28 pm - I returned to the Media View area to record a video, thinking, ""Hey, come on down to Eagle Pass, where the party never stops... for illegal immigrants!""

3:35 pm - At the Texas Border wall, I noticed it was wide open, like a revolving door. 
I strolled through a well-worn path under the train tracks, where I found discarded shoes, coins, and clothing from migrants who had just crossed the Rio Grande.
 It's like a fashion show down there!

A Group of Illegals is Welcomed Miles from the Int‚Äôl Bridge

3:44 pm - 4:00 pm at Eidson Road: A Group of Illegals is Welcomed Miles from the Int‚Äôl Bridge

At an area several miles South of the bridge, US Border Patrol was checking out a group of about 10 young men for weapons and injuries. After a quick 15-minute inspection, they were whisked away in a van. No ID checks, no questions asked. Just another day in the life of the Biden administration's immigration industrial complex.

Cross Rio Grande. Meet US Border Patrol. Get in a ‚ÄúVan,‚Äù and be taken into the USA.

As a US Army veteran, I know the importance of public service. But the federal, state, and local employees have their hands tied by an administration that encourages illegal immigration.

I've been falsely called a racist against people with brown skin and even threatened. What a load of bull! We need people to come here legally, like Nurses, Engineers, and Scientists.

"Thankfully @elonmusk Is Bringing A Lot Of Awareness To Illegals Being Imported To Vote Today. Don't Forget:

Multiple States Have Already Voted To Allow Illegal Immigrants (Non-Citizens) To Vote & Many More States Currently In Process Of Passing Legislation To Allow Them To Vote

This is ON THE RECORD:

‚ÄúNon-citizens have not been eligible to vote in New York or as far as I know in any other state since the 19th century.‚Äù

That's not true. The New York City Council voted in December to allow this. It begins January 9, 2023. Cities in Vermont and Maryland already allow this, and similar measures are under consideration in Illinois, Maine, and Massachusetts right now. Mr. Gentleman, were you? Yes. I believe those are considerations of allowing votes in municipal elections only. Right, but thank you. That's the point. Everybody wants to know at home, why would they allow this? Guys, they're allowing it because they're gonna turn them into voters. They already are doing this in New York City, largest city in America, and this is the plan of our friends on this side to turn all the illegals into voters. That's it, folks. That's what's going on. That's the game. That's why the border's open.

That's why they've dropped it. Look, I respect Ms. Loughran and all her work in this arena. Yes, I'll yield, Mr. Chairman. I'd love to hear what you have to say about this. As a New Yorker, I would love to think that New York is the entire country, but it is not. It is not, and consideration is being given to permitting non-citizens to vote in New York and I believe in the capital city of Vermont, I forget which that is, but it is much as I'd like to believe it, New York and Vermont are not the entire country. 

But Mr. Chairman, that's the whole point. This is what's going on, folks, at home. If you're trying to figure this out, if you're scratching your heads, you've seen the video, you see droves of people, 2.4 million people coming over the border illegally, the president allowing, the Democrats in charge of Congress are allowing it, the deal is they're going to turn them into voters. You just heard it. They don't have any problem with that. They celebrate it. Here's the deal. We have a problem with it. The Constitution has a problem with it. American elections should be decided by American citizens.

That's it. That's what this is about. That's why we're jumping up and down and screaming, my friends on the video who are commenting about this. That's why we're so upset, because our constituents are frightened that we are losing our country. We're losing our security, we're losing our sovereignty, because we're going to allow people from 160 different countries around the world to come in here and decide our elections. That's it. Here it is on record. You all heard it.‚Äù",2024-01-09 00:52:38+00:00

-- Fact 1: Number of Births has ALWAYS been greater than number of Encounters, until September 2023.

-- CBP began using Encounters as a metric in FY2020. You can also easily calculate Encounters yourself going back to FY2012. So ""always"" here means for the entire existence of the Encounters metric.

- False Claim 2: Many of those Encounters led to people being Expelled from the country.
-- Fact 2: Literally ZERO Expulsions happened in any month where Encounters exceeded Births. Title 42 had already expired.

If you're going to attack someone over data, maybe don't make up abject nonsense that anyone can easily disconfirm in 2 seconds.

Media Matters, the brainchild of Clinton loyalist David Brock, calls itself a media watchdog but operates as a DNC front group orchestrating advertiser boycotts and suppressing free speech on social media.

In a shocking federal lawsuit, a Media Matters employee obsessively refreshed a fringe video on @rumblevideo over 70 times until he found a Netflix ad that could be used as fodder for a public pressure campaign.

Despite being the sole viewer of that Netflix ad next to the fringe video, Media Matters falsely insinuated in an article that Netflix ads frequently accompanied fringe content on Rumble, coercing advertisers to abandon the platform.

On @X, Media Matters accessed accounts active for 30 days, bypassing ad filters for new users, and selectively followed accounts with fringe content and those owned by X's major corporate advertisers.

After repeatedly scrolling and refreshing their timeline - 13 more times than an average user - they generated screenshots of fringe content next to X's top advertisers.

Media Matters' defamation was so fabricated that IBM, Comcast, and Oracle had their ads appear next to fringe content for just one account‚Äîan employee of Media Matters‚Äîout of over 550 million active users on @X.

Media Matters conveniently left out these details in their reporting, sidestepping the fact that their reporters manipulated the platform to create fringe content next to major corporate advertisers.

‚Ä¢ Suspended ""Remain in Mexico""
‚Ä¢ Stopped Border Wall Construction

Since these policy changes, over 8 million people have illegally entered the country, with millions more slipping past border patrol undetected.

This surge in illegal immigration is a national security crisis, costing American taxpayers hundreds of billions per year.

Major U.S. cities, grappling with the escalating financial burden, are slashing budgets for essential services such as fire, police, sanitation, and education.

"In light of today‚Äôs news, I thought I would try to take a step back and provide perspective on what this is really all about.

I first became concerned about @Harvard when 34 Harvard student organizations, early on the morning of October 8th before Israel had taken any military actions in Gaza, came out publicly in support of Hamas, a globally recognized terrorist organization, holding Israel ‚Äòsolely responsible‚Äô for Hamas‚Äô barbaric and heinous acts.

How could this be? I wondered.

When I saw President Gay‚Äôs initial statement about the massacre, it provided more context (!) for the student groups‚Äô statement of support for terrorism. The protests began as pro-Palestine and then became anti-Israel.  Shortly, thereafter, antisemitism exploded on campus as protesters who violated Harvard‚Äôs own codes of conduct were emboldened by the lack of enforcement of Harvard‚Äôs rules, and kept testing the limits on how aggressive, intimidating, and disruptive they could be to Jewish and Israeli students, and the student body at large. Sadly, antisemitism remains a simmering source of hate even at our best universities among a subset of students.

A few weeks later, I went up to campus to see things with my own eyes, and listen and learn from students and faculty. I met with 15 or so members of the faculty and a few hundred students in small and large settings, and a clearer picture began to emerge.

I ultimately concluded that antisemitism was not the core of the problem, it was simply a troubling warning sign ‚Äì it was the ‚Äúcanary in the coal mine‚Äù ‚Äì despite how destructive it was in impacting student life and learning on campus.  

I came to learn that the root cause of antisemitism at Harvard was an ideology that had been promulgated on campus, an oppressor/oppressed framework, that provided the intellectual bulwark behind the protests, helping to generate anti-Israel and anti-Jewish hate speech and harassment.

Then I did more research. The more I learned, the more concerned I became, and the more ignorant I realized I had been about DEI, a powerful movement that has not only pervaded Harvard, but the educational system at large. I came to understand that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion was not what I had naively thought these words meant.

I have always believed that diversity is an important feature of a successful organization, but by diversity I mean diversity in its broadest form: diversity of viewpoints, politics, ethnicity, race, age, religion, experience, socioeconomic background, sexual identity, gender, one‚Äôs upbringing, and more. 

What I learned, however, was that DEI was not about diversity in its purest form, but rather DEI was a political advocacy movement on behalf of certain groups that are deemed oppressed under DEI‚Äôs own methodology.

Under DEI, one‚Äôs degree of oppression is determined based upon where one resides on a so-called intersectional pyramid of oppression where whites, Jews, and Asians are deemed oppressors, and a subset of people of color, LGBTQ people, and/or women are deemed to be oppressed. Under this ideology which is the philosophical underpinning of DEI as advanced by Ibram X. Kendi and others, one is either an anti-racist or a racist. There is no such thing as being ‚Äúnot racist.‚Äù

Under DEI‚Äôs ideology, any policy, program, educational system, economic system, grading system, admission policy, (and even climate change due its disparate impact on geographies and the people that live there), etc. that leads to unequal outcomes among people of different skin colors is deemed racist. 

As a result, according to DEI, capitalism is racist, Advanced Placement exams are racist, IQ tests are racist, corporations are racist, or in other words, any merit-based program, system, or organization which has or generates outcomes for different races that are at variance with the proportion these different races represent in the population at large is by definition racist under DEI‚Äôs ideology.

In order to be deemed anti-racist, one must personally take action to reverse any unequal outcomes in society. The DEI movement, which has permeated many universities, corporations, and state, local and federal governments, is designed to be the anti-racist engine to transform society from its currently structurally racist state to an anti-racist one.

After the death of George Floyd, the already burgeoning DEI movement took off without any real challenge to its problematic ideology. Why, you might ask, was there so little pushback? The answer is that anyone who dared to raise a question which challenged DEI was deemed a racist, a label which could severely impact one‚Äôs employment, social status, reputation and more. Being called a racist got people cancelled, so those concerned about DEI and its societal and legal implications had no choice but to keep quiet in this new climate of fear.

The techniques that DEI has used to squelch the opposition are found in the Red Scares and McCarthyism of decades past. If you challenge DEI, ‚Äújustice‚Äù will be swift, and you may find yourself unemployed, shunned by colleagues, cancelled, and/or you will otherwise put your career and acceptance in society at risk.

The DEI movement has also taken control of speech. Certain speech is no longer permitted. So-called ‚Äúmicroaggressions‚Äù are treated like hate speech. ‚ÄúTrigger warnings‚Äù are required to protect students. ‚ÄúSafe spaces‚Äù are necessary to protect students from the trauma inflicted by words that are challenging to the students‚Äô newly-acquired world views. Campus speakers and faculty with unapproved views are shouted down, shunned, and cancelled.

These speech codes have led to self-censorship by students and faculty of views privately held, but no longer shared. There is no commitment to free expression at Harvard other than for DEI-approved views. This has led to the quashing of conservative and other viewpoints from the Harvard campus and faculty, and contributed to Harvard‚Äôs having the lowest free speech ranking of 248 universities assessed by the Foundation of Individual Rights and Expression.

When one examines DEI and its ideological heritage, it does not take long to understand that the movement is inherently inconsistent with basic American values. Our country since its founding has been about creating and building a democracy with equality of opportunity for all. Millions of people have left behind socialism and communism to come to America to start again, as they have seen the destruction leveled by an equality of outcome society.

The E for ‚Äúequity‚Äù in DEI is about equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity.

DEI is racist because reverse racism is racism, even if it is against white people (and it is remarkable that I even need to point this out). Racism against white people has become considered acceptable by many not to be racism, or alternatively, it is deemed acceptable racism. While this is, of course, absurd, it has become the prevailing view in many universities around the country.

You can say things about white people today in universities, in business or otherwise, that if you switched the word ‚Äòwhite‚Äô to ‚Äòblack,‚Äô the consequences to you would be costly and severe.

To state what should otherwise be self-evident, whether or not a statement is racist should not depend upon whether the target of the racism is a group who currently represents a majority or minority of the country or those who have a lighter or darker skin color. Racism against whites is as reprehensible as it is against groups with darker skin colors.

Martin Luther King‚Äôs most famous words are instructive:

‚ÄúI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.‚Äù

But here we are in 2024, being asked and in some cases required to use skin color to effect outcomes in admissions (recently deemed illegal by the Supreme Court), in business (likely illegal yet it happens nonetheless) and in government (also I believe in most cases to be illegal, except apparently in government contracting), rather than the content of one‚Äôs character. As such, a meritocracy is an anathema to the DEI movement. DEI is inherently a racist and illegal movement in its implementation even if it purports to work on behalf of the so-called oppressed.

And DEI‚Äôs definition of oppressed is fundamentally flawed.

I have always believed that the most fortunate should help the least fortunate, and that our system should be designed in such a way as to maximize the size of the overall pie so that it will enable us to provide an economic system which can offer quality of life, education, housing, and healthcare for all.

America is a rich country and we have made massive progress over the decades toward achieving this goal, but we obviously have much more work to do. Steps taken on the path to socialism ‚Äì another word for an equality of outcome system ‚Äì will reverse this progress and ultimately impoverish us all. We have seen this movie many times.

Having a darker skin color, a less common sexual identity, and/or being a woman doesn‚Äôt make one necessarily oppressed or even disadvantaged. While slavery remains a permanent stain on our country‚Äôs history ‚Äì a fact which is used by DEI to label white people as oppressors ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt therefore hold that all white people generations after the abolishment of slavery should be held responsible for its evils. Similarly, the fact that Columbus discovered America doesn‚Äôt make all modern-day Italians colonialists.

An ideology that portrays a bicameral world of oppressors and the oppressed based principally on race or sexual identity is a fundamentally racist ideology that will likely lead to more racism rather than less. A system where one obtains advantages by virtue of one‚Äôs skin color is a racist system, and one that will generate resentment and anger among the un-advantaged who will direct their anger at the favored groups. 

The country has seen burgeoning resentment and anger grow materially over the last few years, and the DEI movement is an important contributor to our growing divisiveness. Resentment is one of the most important drivers of racism. And it is the lack of equity, i.e, fairness, in how DEI operates, that contributes to this resentment.

I was accused of being a racist from the President of the NAACP among others when I posted on @X that I had learned that the Harvard President search process excluded candidates that did not meet the DEI criteria. I didn‚Äôt say that former President Gay was hired because she was a black woman. I simply said that I had heard that the search process by its design excluded a large percentage of potential candidates due to the DEI limitations. My statement was not a racist one. It was simply the empirical truth about the Harvard search process that led to Gay‚Äôs hiring.

When former President Gay was hired, I knew little about her, but I was instinctually happy for Harvard and the black community. Every minority community likes to see their representatives recognized in important leadership positions, and it is therefore an important moment for celebration. I too celebrated this achievement.  I am inspired and moved by others‚Äô success, and I thought of Gay‚Äôs hiring at the pinnacle leadership position at perhaps our most important and iconic university as an important and significant milestone for the black community.

I have spent the majority of my life advocating on behalf of and supporting members of disadvantaged communities including by investing several hundreds of millions of dollars of philanthropic assets to help communities in need with economic development, sensible criminal justice reform, poverty reduction, healthcare, education, workforce housing, charter schools, and more.

I have done the same at Pershing Square Capital Management when, for example, we completed one of the largest IPOs ever with the substantive assistance of a number of minority-owned, women-owned, and Veteran-owned investment banks. Prior to the Pershing Square Tontine, Ltd. IPO, it was standard practice for big corporations occasionally to name a few minority-owned banks in their equity and bond offerings, have these banks do no work and sell only a de minimis amount of stock or bonds, and allocate to them only 1% or less of the underwriting fees so that the issuers could virtue signal that they were helping minority communities.

In our IPO, we invited the smaller banks into the deal from the beginning of the process so they could add real value. As a result, the Tontine IPO was one of the largest and most successful IPOs in history with $12 billion of demand for a $4 billion deal by the second day of the IPO, when we closed the books. The small banks earned their 20% share of the fees for delivering real and substantive value and for selling their share of the stock. 

Compare this approach to the traditional one where the small banks do effectively nothing to earn their fees ‚Äì they aren‚Äôt given that opportunity ‚Äì yet, they get a cut of the deal, albeit a tiny one. The traditional approach does not create value for anyone. It only creates resentment, and an uncomfortable feeling from the small banks who get a tiny piece of the deal in a particularly bad form of affirmative action.

While I don‚Äôt think our approach to working with the smaller banks has yet achieved the significant traction it deserves, it will hopefully happen eventually as the smaller banks build their competencies and continue to earn their fees, and other issuers see the merit of this approach. We are going to need assistance with a large IPO soon so we are looking forward to working with our favored smaller banks.

I have always believed in giving disadvantaged groups a helping hand. I signed the Giving Pledge for this reason. My life plan by the time I was 18 was to be successful and then return the favor to those less fortunate. This always seemed to the right thing to do, in particular, for someone as fortunate as I am.

All of the above said, it is one thing to give disadvantaged people the opportunities and resources so that they can help themselves. It is another to select a candidate for admission or for a leadership role when they are not qualified to serve in that role.

This appears to have been the case with former President Gay‚Äôs selection. She did not possess the leadership skills to serve as Harvard‚Äôs president, putting aside any questions about her academic credentials. This became apparent shortly after October 7th, but there were many signs before then when she was Dean of the faculty.

The result was a disaster for Harvard and for Claudine Gay.

The Harvard board should not have run a search process which had a predetermined objective of only hiring a DEI-approved candidate. In any case, there are many incredibly talented black men and women who could have been selected by Harvard to serve as its president so why did the Harvard Corporation board choose Gay?

One can only speculate without knowing all of the facts, but it appears Gay‚Äôs leadership in the creation of Harvard‚Äôs Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging and the penetration of the DEI ideology into the Corporation board room perhaps made Gay the favored candidate.  The search was also done at a time when many other top universities had similar DEI-favored candidate searches underway for their presidents, reducing the number of potential candidates available in light of the increased competition for talent.

Unrelated to the DEI issue, as a side note, I would suggest that universities should broaden their searches to include capable business people for the role of president, as a university president requires more business skills than can be gleaned from even the most successful academic career with its hundreds of peer reviewed papers and many books. Universities have a Dean of the Faculty and a bureaucracy to oversee the faculty and academic environment of the university.  It therefore does not make sense that the university president has to come through the ranks of academia, with a skill set unprepared for university management.

The president‚Äôs job ‚Äì managing thousands of employees, overseeing a $50 billion endowment, raising money, managing expenses, capital allocation, real estate acquisition, disposition, and construction, and reputation management ‚Äì are responsibilities that few career academics are capable of executing. Broadening the recruitment of candidates to include top business executives would also create more opportunities for diverse talent for the office of the university president.

Furthermore, Harvard is a massive business that has been mismanaged for a long time. The cost structure of the University is out of control due in large part to the fact that the administration has grown without bounds. Revenues are below what they should be because the endowment has generated a 4.5% annualized return for the last decade in one of the greatest bull markets in history, and that low return is not due to the endowment taking lower risks as the substantial majority of its assets are invested in illiquid and other high-risk assets.

The price of the product, a Harvard education, has risen at a rate well in excess of inflation for decades, (I believe it has grown about 7-8% per annum) and it is now about $320,000 for four years of a liberal arts education at Harvard College. As a result, the only students who can now afford Harvard come from rich families and poor ones. The middle class can‚Äôt get enough financial aid other than by borrowing a lot of money, and it is hard to make the economics work in life after college when you graduate with large loan balances, particularly if you also attend graduate school.

The best companies in the world grow at high rates over many decades. Harvard has grown at a de minimis rate. Since I graduated 35 years ago, the number of students in the Harvard class has grown by less than 20%. What other successful business do you know that has grown the number of customers it serves by less than 20% in 35 years, and where nearly all revenue growth has come from raising prices?

In summary, there is a lot more work to be done to fix Harvard than just replacing its president. That said, the selection of Harvard‚Äôs next president is a critically important task, and the individuals principally responsible for that decision do not have a good track record for doing so based on their recent history, nor have they done a good job managing the other problems which I have identified above.

The Corporation board led by Penny Pritzker selected the wrong president and did inadequate due diligence about her academic record despite Gay being in leadership roles at the University since 2015 when she became dean of the Social Studies department.

The Board failed to create a discrimination-free environment on campus exposing the University to tremendous reputational damage, to large legal and financial liabilities, Congressional investigations and scrutiny, and to the potential loss of Federal funding, all while damaging the learning environment for all students.

And when concerns were raised about plagiarism in Gay‚Äôs research, the Board said these claims were ‚Äúdemonstrably false‚Äù and it threatened the NY Post with ‚Äúimmense‚Äù liability if it published a story raising these issues.

It was only after getting the story cancelled that the Board secretly launched a cursory, short-form investigation outside of the proper process for evaluating a member of the faculty‚Äôs potential plagiarism. When the Board finally publicly acknowledged some of Gay‚Äôs plagiarism, it characterized the plagiarism as ‚Äúunintentional‚Äù and invented new euphemisms, i.e., ‚Äúduplicative language‚Äù to describe plagiarism, a belittling of academic integrity that has caused grave damage to Harvard‚Äôs academic standards and credibility.

The Board‚Äôs three-person panel of ‚Äúpolitical scientist experts‚Äù that to this day remain unnamed who evaluated Gay‚Äôs work failed to identify many examples of her plagiarism, leading to even greater reputational damage to the University and its reputation for academic integrity as the whistleblower and the media continued to identify additional problems with Gay‚Äôs work in the days and weeks thereafter.

According to the NY Post, the Board also apparently sought to identify the whistleblower and seek retribution against him or her in contravention to the University‚Äôs whistleblower protection policies.

Despite all of the above, the Board ‚Äúunanimously‚Äù gave its full support for Gay during this nearly four-month crisis, until eventually being forced to accept her resignation earlier today, a grave and continuing reputational disaster to Harvard and to the Board.

In a normal corporate context with the above set of facts, the full board would resign immediately to be replaced by a group nominated by shareholders. In the case of Harvard, however, the Board nominates itself and its new members. There is no shareholder vote mechanism to replace them.

So what should happen?

The Corporation Board should not remain in their seats protected by the unusual governance structure which enabled them to obtain their seats. 

The Board Chair, Penny Pritzker, should resign along with the other members of the board who led the campaign to keep Claudine Gay, orchestrated the strategy to threaten the media, bypassed the process for evaluating plagiarism, and otherwise greatly contributed to the damage that has been done. Then new Corporation board members should be identified who bring true diversity, viewpoint and otherwise, to the board.

The Board should not be principally comprised of individuals who share the same politics and views about DEI. The new board members should be chosen in a transparent process with the assistance of the 30-person Board of Overseers. There is no reason the Harvard board of 12 independent trustees cannot be comprised of the most impressive, high integrity, intellectually and politically diverse members of our country and globe. We have plenty of remarkable people to choose from, and the job of being a director just got much more interesting and important. It is no longer, nor should it ever have been, an honorary and highly political sinecure.

The ODEIB should be shut down, and the staff should be terminated. The ODEIB has already taken down much of the ideology and strategies that were on its website when I and others raised concerns about how the office operates and who it does and does not represent. Taking down portions of the website does not address the fundamentally flawed and racist ideology of this office, and calls into further question the ODEIB‚Äôs legitimacy. 

Why would the ODEIB take down portions of its website when an alum questioned its legitimacy unless the office was doing something fundamentally wrong or indefensible?

Harvard must once again become a meritocratic institution which does not discriminate for or against faculty or students based on their skin color, and where diversity is understood in its broadest form so that students can learn in an environment which welcomes diverse viewpoints from faculty and students from truly diverse backgrounds and experiences.

Harvard must create an academic environment with real academic freedom and free speech, where self-censoring, speech codes, and cancel culture are forever banished from campus.  

Harvard should become an environment where all students of all persuasions feel comfortable expressing their views and being themselves. In the business world, we call this creating a great corporate culture, which begins with new leadership and the right tone at the top. It does not require the creation of a massive administrative bureaucracy.

These are the minimum changes necessary to begin to repair the damage that has been done.

A number of faculty at the University of Pennsylvania have proposed a new constitution which can be found at https://t.co/Vggm1eomnI, which has been signed by more than 1,200 faculty from Penn, Harvard, and other universities. Harvard would do well to adopt Penn‚Äôs proposed new constitution or a similar one before seeking to hire its next president. 

A condition of employment of the new Harvard president should be the requirement that the new president agrees to strictly abide by the new constitution. He or she should take an oath to that effect.

Today was an important step forward for the University.  It is time we restore Veritas to Harvard and again be an exemplar that graduates well-informed, highly-educated leaders of exemplary moral standing and good judgment who can help bring our country together, advance our democracy, and identify the important new discoveries that will help save us from ourselves.

We have a lot more work to do. Let‚Äôs get at it.",2024-01-03 07:03:29+00:00

In principle, you could train with nothing in between, because that's what humans are doing with a biological neural net, you could train based on video, and what trains the video is the moving of the steering wheel and the pedals, with no other software in between.

""I think there was a massive corporate lobby for cheap labor in the US and that is the main thing that's going on.

The guy was going on and on about how he hates Trump and when I asked why he said 'Donald Trump's border policy has cut down the number of illegal immigrants and now I'm forced to pay American workers more.'

He just admitted it openly.

So people want cheap labor.

Number two, it's a power dynamic. Kamala and Democrats want to give millions of immigrants the right to vote, they want them to participate in elections, and that's the end of American democracy.

If Kamala gets these people to vote Democrat, Republicans will never win another election in my lifetime. The Republicans can't compete with them, because we would have to be more evil than them, and it would turn the nation blue forever.

‚ÄúWhat I see happening under the Biden-Kamala administration is a deliberate attempt to import as many people as possible into swing states like Pennsylvania, in order to ensure that America becomes a permanent one-party state.

The numbers are truly staggering, and the fake legacy media doesn't report on them. The only reason anyone knows about it is if you're on the X platform. It's crazy. 

This is from the government website, which is run by Democrats. You're seeing, in some cases, 700% increases in the past 3.5 years in illegals in swing states. What a coincidence.

And when you're talking about elections that are won or lost by 10,000 or 20,000 votes, and then you bring in 200,000 people, and then you put them on the fast track to citizenship, this is without considering any cheating, if this is legalized, that happens over the next four years, there will be no swing states.

They're importing voters, I think that's obvious to anyone who looks, and we will have a situation like we have in California, where it's a one-party state. California is a supermajority Democratic state. So, it's one-party rule. If you have one-party rule, that's not a democracy.‚Äù

A lot of them are trying to reimpose that social trust from the top, not recognizing that social trust came organically from the way American society worked. 

""If you have people trying to reimpose it from the top, it degrades the very social trust you're trying to create. I've seen family members of mine who got really radicalized by saying wait a second, should we be masking 3-year-olds in our schools? They would get kicked off Facebook because a person with 900 Facebook friends dared to question the prevailing narrative, and again, they ended up being right about it.

Over time, I have seen our government‚Äôs approach to space wax and wane.

Under President Trump‚Äôs first term, America saw a revitalized interest in Space, and his Administration reignited national efforts to get back to the Moon, and push on to Mars. The Trump Administration also reinstituted the National Space Council, and our Nation‚Äôs defense was enhanced with the creation of the U.S. Space Force ‚Äì increasingly important as space becomes a contested domain.

"Introducing Lightning Notes ‚ö° People want fast notes. So we re-architected the system to score notes faster. Since rolling this out, we‚Äôve seen notes go live in as little as 14m33s after being written, and 18m20s after the post itself was written. Ludicrously fast? Now reality!

Think about what needs to happen for useful context to be added to a post:
‚Ä¢ Post has to be seen
‚Ä¢ Post has to be evaluated ‚Äî is it accurate? is the image real? is the video from today or 5 years ago? etc
‚Ä¢ Sources need to be found ‚Äî reverse image search? original video? raw data? helpful article or analysis?
‚Ä¢ Proposed context needs to be written
‚Ä¢ Proposed context needs to be reviewed by people from different perspectives for helpfulness, accuracy, etc

Thanks to Community Notes‚Äô 800k+ global contributors and our new scoring architecture, it is now possible for this entire process to happen in under 20 minutes.

Contributors can also write notes on specific images or videos. These media notes show automatically on new posts with matching media, without any additional work from contributors.

Speed matters. External research made possible by notes‚Äô open source data has shown that notes reduce sharing of posts by ~60%, increase deletion of posts by ~80%, and are highly accurate. On top of that, notes are found helpful by people from different perspectives, and people from across the political spectrum find notes significantly more trustworthy than traditional misinformation flags. See the studies: https://t.co/sqJbGzFlqq

In the past two weeks:
‚Ä¢ Over 400 notes started showing <1hr after being written. They‚Äôre automatically showing on over 8000 posts and have been seen over 200M times.
‚Ä¢ Over 60 notes starting showing <1hr after the post itself went live. They‚Äôre automatically showing on over 1000 posts and have been seen over 21M times.

Now, when you see a note that goes live in under 60 minutes, you‚Äôll see a lightning indicator on it, recognizing the incredible work of contributors who make this happen:

‚Üí Starliner program has been marred by years of glitches with more than $1.8 billion in cost overruns and delays despite NASA awarding Boeing nearly twice as much funding as it did to @SpaceX in 2014 ‚Äî Boeing is still trying to resolve issues experienced during Starliner's test flight in the hope of eventually getting it certified for regular flights.

Meanwhile, SpaceX Dragon spacecraft made 43 visits to the ISS since 2019, carrying both crew and cargo for NASA ‚Äî The agency recently even hired SpaceX to rescue two Americans stuck at the space station, after Starliner‚Äôs problems forced the agency to order the vehicle to return to Earth empty.

‚Üí Boeing and Lockheed Martin have been trying to sell their United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture over the past year. 

In the last decade, Boeing's ULA has fallen behind major technological leaps made by SpaceX, which has slashed the cost of space travel by reusing boosters and building a majority of components in-house.

‚Üí Boeing‚Äôs space portfolio also includes a lucrative contract for NASA‚Äôs SLS moon rocket, though it‚Äôs expected to cost about $2 billion per launch while SpaceX is working on a much cheaper alternative.

SpaceX has recently showcased its revolutionary Raptor 3 engine and, two weeks ago, successfully achieved all the mission goals set forth for Starship Flight 5, including the unprecedented engineering feat of a mid-air capture of its Super Heavy Booster with Mechazilla ‚Äî and Starship Flight 6 is said to happen very soon.

At the most recent Luzerne County Board of Elections meeting, 

Manager Romilda Crocamo revealed that

‚ÄúBeth McBride dropped off and dumped a numerous amount of applications.

They were delivered to the Bureau of Election on the last day of registration.‚Äù

‚û°Ô∏è Beth McBride was the acting Director of Elections when Luzerne County ‚ÄºÔ∏èran out of paper on Election Day in 2022‚ÄºÔ∏è

Recently, Lancaster County uncovered a voter registration fraud operation:

2,500 applications (the majority of which are fraudulent) were turned in on or near the deadline ‚Äî just like Luzerne ‚Äî & are linked to an organization that began efforts in June.

I am calling for an immediate investigation into the ‚Äúnumerous amount of applications‚Äù turned in to the Luzerne Bureau of Elections on Monday, October 21st. 

Contact Luzerne District Attorney Samuel M. Sanguedolce & demand that he investigate. The details mimic a current investigation in Lancaster County. 

After contacting the DA, contact your elected officials in the Pennsylvania State House & State Senate and demand they bring attention to this.

How many other counties received a massive amount of voter registration applications on the deadline that are dated back to June? 

If we do not address these inconsistencies, Pennsylvania voters cannot have confidence in fair & free elections.

"üá∫üá∏ SURGE IN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IN SWING STATES UNDER BIDEN-HARRIS

Illegal immigration populations have surged dramatically in several swing states since the start of the Biden-Harris administration.

Michigan leads with a staggering 775% increase, followed by Arizona at 734%, Nevada at 562%, and Wisconsin at 467%. North Carolina saw a 446% rise, Georgia 401%, and Pennsylvania 241%.

These figures could have major implications for the political landscape in these key states.

‚ÄúThe larger government gets, the less individual freedom you have. I think that's really the core thing. 

Your freedoms have just been eroded year after year with more and more government, laws and regulations and regulatory authorities.

When I looked it up, there were apparently 428 federal agencies. What the hell do you need 428 agencies for? Why do you even need 100? This is crazy.

They're currently making new agencies at a rate of two per year. And every one of them is chipping away at your freedom.

So, it's essential for us to unwind that process and restore your personal freedom. And with that will come great prosperity and personal happiness, I believe.‚Äù

""I was living in California and everyone around me was a Democrat and I really just wanted to build technology: cars, rockets, space, internet, and do useful things. I didn't want to be involved in politics, I don't want to be the President, I want to build products people love. 

I came to a conclusion that we are at a fork in the road of Western Civilization and destiny of humanity, because the constitution is being eroded away with consistent attacks, and the oppressive nature of the Federal government getting worse every year, open borders, etc.

"The rate of improvement in $TSLA's FSD disengagement ratio is stunning‚Äîit's proof that scaling laws apply to self-driving and real-world AI. Piecing together the progress:

v13: 5-6x improved Miles per Critical Intervention (""mpci"") (Source: Tesla 3Q Earnings Call)
v12.5: 3x improved mpci (Source: https://t.co/4oCw49Tmsm)
v12.4: 5-10x improvement over v12.3 (Source: https://t.co/qRW5BW9oUu)
Compared to Jan 2024 (v12.1): v12.5 shows 100x improvement; v13 will show a 1,000x improvement (Source: Tesla 3Q Earnings Call)
By 2Q25, expect FSD to be safer than a human driver (Source: Tesla 3Q Earnings Call)

‚ñ∂Ô∏èComparison 1 ‚Äì Human Driver:

Miles per reported accident = 550k (Total miles driven in the U.S. per year = 3.3 trillion; Total reported accidents in the U.S. annually = 6 million)

This means around 60k miles per minor incident, which lines up with the average American driving 13.5k miles/year, having an accident every 3 years.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èComparison 2 ‚Äì Waymo:

Waymo's miles per disengagement = 17k (Source: California DMV, 2023)
It‚Äôs likely higher now, but the exact number isn‚Äôt public.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èIf the math is right, FSD would hit ~100k mpci by 2Q25, meaning v13 is above 10k (20k?) mpci, and v12.5 ~5k. In Jan 2024 (v12.1), this was likely just ~50 miles per disengagement. driver's
I can only imagine the scaling here to continue, with more data, better inferencing hardware (HW5 or AI5 next summer?), and more training capacity over time.

‚è≥A few thoughts I‚Äôve been having about FSD/robotaxi, would love to hear pushbacks:

1/ Why does $TSLA need a new Cybercab model when they can use the Model 3/Y for autonomous driving?

It‚Äôs about cost + adoption. Autonomous driving is a futuristic concept that requires a ton of public education. A sleek, futuristic car with *no steering wheel* running autonomously is the best ad for self-driving. Makes total sense to me that $TSLA saw a significant jump in FSD adoption post 10/10 (Source: 3Q earnings call). Also, Cybercab will cost around $25k, with 5x better cycle times and reduced parts, making it an efficient choice for scaling.

2/ What‚Äôs causing the discrepancy between my math and engagement ratios from trackers (~200 miles)? Why does it feel different in a $TSLA vs. a Waymo in terms of the urge to disengage?

I think most tracker data comes from user-reported disengagements, and when sitting in the driver's seat, you naturally feel more responsible, leading to a stronger urge to intervene. But this doesn‚Äôt mean every disengagement was necessary to avoid an accident. The experience sitting in the passenger seat (like in $Waymo) feels entirely different‚Äî""out of sight, out of mind.""

3/ Why start the robotaxi fleet with the Model 3/Y?

Apart from fast production, it likely has to do with regulation. As Elon mentioned, each state has its own requirements for whether a safety driver is needed to get approval, and using existing models like the Model 3/Y allows $TSLA to adapt more quickly to these differences.

‚è≥Other thoughts:

How will robotaxis impact car ownership?
On one hand, robotaxis lower the cost of ownership, making it more accessible and driving adoption. Plus, your car could generate income for you (+ve for ownership). But, on the other hand, with autonomous fleets available, the need to actually own a car could diminish.

Autonomous trucking & the disruptions?
It‚Äôs not just passenger cars getting autonomous‚ÄîElon mentioned Semi trucks will also become autonomous! This could disrupt industries like logistics, freight, and transportation, with major implications for shipping costs, delivery times, and employment in those sectors.

Regulation? Why does it have to be state-by-state?
We really need national-level approval for autonomous driving instead of the current state-by-state process, which is inefficient and unclear. 

üöóü§ñ $TSLA has been criticized for overpromising FSD for years, but now they‚Äôre at a tipping point. The value of autonomy is about to be fully realized. Truly a ‚Äúmany companies in one‚Äù.

"You want to know why nobody cares about the Left-wing media's latest oppo dump? The answer is obvious: people care about the quality of their lives. And life is getting worse under Democratic governance.

Here's just a quick story.

We're in LA this week. So we decided to go out with some friends, a husband and wife. Nice area of the city, well lit, not too late at night. 

We finish dinner at around 10:30 and head back to our car. Since my wife and I have 24/7 security, we're safe. Not so for our friends. They get to their car...

And as soon as they do, a Hyundai without plates speeds up and stops. Three young black guys jump out of the car (suspect description relevant because they're still at large!) and rush up to my friend, yank him out of his car, and grab his watch, phone and wallet. They then sprint around the car and grab his wife, start trying to pull off her jewelry. She screams and kicks, and presumably losing time, they take off in top gear down the street.

As stated, they're still at large. It took about 15 minutes for the cops to arrive. Not their fault -- LA is wildly understaffed, and the LAPD has been treated horribly by the city government, such that officers have been targeted for simply doing their jobs. I know and am friends with many of them. My friend and his wife weren't armed up, either, because it's nearly impossible to carry a gun in LA legally, and also because if you shoot a criminal in LA, there's a solid shot YOU end up in jail.

Now, here's the thing. My friend and his wife have lived in LA for decades. In the last several years, they've been assaulted more than once on the street. Zero arrests. Zero prosecutions.

This is just one of the reasons we left LA, where I had lived my entire life. And it's getting worse, not better.

This is why people increasingly don't give a shit about the media's latest horror story about Trump Saying Bad Things‚Ñ¢. The same people who maintain that street crime is no big deal, or a reflection of institutional racism, or that inflation is hunky dory, or that biggest issue in American life is whether or not Billy has the right to be called Susan...these are not serious people.

‚ÄúI do think there is an important threshold if we are able to make life multiplanetary, that you can get to the point on Mars where Mars can grow by itself, even if the resupply ships from Earth stop coming.

That's the critical threshold where the probable lifespan of civilization is dramatically greater.

So, it's not enough just to go to Mars and have a small base or something like that.

You've got to actually have enough resources on Mars that if resupply ships stop coming for any reason, and it could be that things on Earth ended with a bang or a whimper, and currently it's trending to end, it's sort of tragic, currently things are trending to end with a whimper in adult diapers because of the lack of birth rate, but as soon as we can make life multiplanetary, sustainably multiplanetary, the probable lifespan of civilization is dramatically greater.

And I think that's really the fundamental test, can we get to that point before civilization collapses?

Can we make life multiplanetary, sustainably multiplanetary before something happens on Earth to prevent that from occurring?

And if we do, the future is exciting and bright, and Mars may one day come back and save Earth, just like America came back and saved Europe and saved the rest of the world three times last century.

Three times, America saved the world last century.

And what a disaster would have been if America had not existed.

And one day, Mars may play that same role on Earth.‚Äù

"I can't stand Donald Trump. He is braggy, he insults people for no reason, and he is just a brutal personality. But my mind is made up. I'm voting for him and here's why:

* He puts Americans and their well-being first. Kamala will not. 

* He will bring @elonmusk into his cabinet to be the efficiency czar and get rid of waste. This alone may be the best single reason to vote for him. 

* He will bring @RobertKennedyJr into his cabinet to Make American Healthy Again. He will finally get to the bottom of why our food companies are destroying the health of our children.

* I'm sick of the way the media lies continuously about @realDonaldTrump, starting with the incessant racism claims. They are just nonsense. The latest thing I learned? He sent his plane to fly Nelson Mandela home after he was in jail with the U.S. wouldn't do it. Racist? No.

* I'm sick of the U.S. being embroiled in foreign wars. Trump will keep us out of them again. He's just crazy enough that foreign nations will stand down. They have no fear of Kamala. They will fear him.

* Trump sees this country as fundamentally good. Kamala sees it as inherently evil.

* Trump will end the nonsense of the open border which makes our country less secure, less financially stable, and brings in millions of people illegally who compete for Americans' jobs.

* This government has to print billions to care for the illegals. That makes all of our dollars less valuable and makes prices zoom upward.

* He will stockpile Bitcoin.

* He will keep men out of women's bathrooms and women's sports.

* He is a heavyweight personality and negotiator. Kamala is a phony personality and a lightweight negotiator.

* The people who want Kamala Harris to win are the most annoying people in the country. They have pushed for pronouns, masks, endless vaccines, cancel culture, riots, blatant racism towards whites, gender confusion, undermining the U.S. constitution.

* He will upset the current political system. He was nearly the victim of assassination 3x. And he keeps going. He's not the best in interviews, but he at least puts himself out there. Over and over and over. Kamala hasn't done a single press conference.

* Harris and the media trying to prop her up hid Biden's cognitive decline. They accuse @realDonaldTrump of being a threat to democracy. Yet she was installed as the nominee with no votes. She wants to pack the Supreme Court. She wants to eliminate the filibuster. She sued @RobertKennedyJr to keep him off the ballot. And the threat to democracy is Trump? Nonsense.

* Those who support Harris look at Trump supports as vile, stupid, ignorant, and fascists. They disown family members or disinvite them from Thanksgiving dinner of they support Trump. This is disgraceful.

* Every time she talks, I try to give her a chance. But she is the most phony and condescending politician I have ever seen. Ever. I can't do it. I won't do it.

* She and those who support her are resistant to Voter ID and believe requiring an ID is racist. Her Department of Justice is suing the state of Virginia for trying to purge the voter rolls of illegals. Why would we not want 1 vote per 1 U.S. citizen? Is it more racist to believe people from the inner city are perfectly capable of securing a government issued ID? Or to believe they are incapable?

At some of the companies, engineering talent is suppressed in a way that is maybe not obviously bad, but where it's just so comfortable, and you're paid so much money, but the output you actually have to produce is so low that it's like a honey trap.

Through one lens, Tesla is a public company with a premium valuation that often rides a rollercoaster of momentum.

But many investors wanted immediate, tangible details they could underwrite‚Äîsomething they could taste now, rather than imagine for the future. The perils of being a public company.

Now, set aside most of the pubco dynamics and look at things from a different perspective. One of the most accomplished entrepreneurs, with more financial resources than anyone else in the world, just gave us a decent glimpse of his vision for the future. Whatever your take on the CyberCab, RoboVan, or the state of autonomous driving, these concepts point toward a transportation future that is more environmentally sustainable, safer and efficient‚Äîwith real corporate revenue optionality. Equally importantly, they inject a sense of futuristic excitement that inspires others to embark on similar grand endeavors. 

As for Optimus, the AI-powered humanoid robot, it looked noticeably improved from its last appearance. That is progress. A robot like that, priced similarly to a car, has the potential to be a force multiplier with far-reaching global economic implications.

So the guy may be off on his timelines, but at least someone is taking these ambitious moonshots. He has the talented workforce, the resources and the experience to will these futuristic endeavors into reality.

"NEWS: The WSJ Editorial Board has released a new opinion piece on @Starlink titled ""Elon Musk Rides to Biden‚Äôs Hurricane Rescue""

WSJ: ""The FCC withdrew a grant for Starlink to cover rural counties, but the satellite service is now saving the day in those counties.

The FCC awarded Starlink the grant in 2020 because it can cover remote regions at lower cost than traditional broadband providers. But the FCC‚Äôs Democratic majority revoked Starlink‚Äôs funding last year, claiming it wasn‚Äôt making fast enough progress to connect rural Americans‚Äînever mind that other FCC funding recipients weren‚Äôt doing any better.

The Biden FCC majority called Starlink unproven and unreliable, though Ukraine‚Äôs military and people were relying on its service after Russia destroyed other networks. As GOP commissioner Brendan Carr noted in dissent, the FCC‚Äôs decision ‚Äúcannot be explained by any objective application of law, facts, or policy,‚Äù adding that the decision ‚Äúfits the Biden Administration‚Äôs pattern of regulatory harassment‚Äù of Mr. Musk‚Äôs businesses.

The de-funding by Democrats is now looking even more political. Two weeks ago FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel granted Dish Network chairman Charlie Ergen a three-year extension to meet FCC deadlines to build out his fledgling 5G network and avoid stiff penalties for squatting on valuable spectrum. Starlink was well on its way to meeting its commitments to the FCC, but Mr. Ergen wasn‚Äôt close to meeting his.

Ah, but Mr. Ergen is a Biden-Harris campaign donor while Mr. Musk is a critic. Note also that Dish lobbied the FCC in 2022 to scrap the Starlink award, saying it ‚Äúcannot credibly claim that it will be able to fulfill its obligations.‚Äù Perhaps Mr. Ergen hopes to win federal funding to cover the rural areas that the FCC had tapped Starlink to connect.

It would be better if the government weren‚Äôt subsidizing the expansion of any private broadband networks. But if they‚Äôre going to pick winners and losers, the feds should do so based on objective criteria and ensure taxpayer money is spent efficiently.""

She says they introduced a bill upon taking office (that bill would‚Äôve given given an 8 year path to amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants) then pivots to saying Trump killed the bipartisan border deal - which, again, the admin did not attempt until after 3 years of record setting chaos. Harris never actually answers the question as to why they waited 3 years to attempt to stop the chaos at the executive level. And a reminder about those record setting numbers, they do not include the more than 1.9 million known gotaways who were recorded entering the U.S. without apprehension. Gotaways under Biden/Harris in 3 years were higher than the prior decade of Trump + Obama - combined and there were times when entire chunks of the border were left completely unmanned to focus resources on processing/mass catch & release instead.

"ENDORSEMENT: Why is it, one must ask, that the collective outrage machine revs to full throttle upon hearing that @elonmusk  has dared to endorse Donald Trump, while the same critical tongues remain curiously silent when the New York Times predictably throws its weight behind Kamala Harris or, indeed, any other Democratic candidate? At the heart of this disparity lies a fundamental misunderstanding of the players involved.

Let us first consider ùïè, the platform formerly known as Twitter, and its role in this electoral drama. ùïè is precisely that‚Äîa platform. It does not opine, it does not advocate; it simply facilitates the free exchange of ideas, opinions, and, yes, even endorsements. Elon Musk, for all his eccentricities and immense influence, is but a single user of this vast public square. His endorsement of Donald Trump is no more the official position of ùïè than your local tavern‚Äôs musings on politics reflect the views of the walls that contain it. Musk, as a private citizen and the steward of this platform, is endorsing the candidate he believes will best safeguard the principles of free speech‚Äîthe very lifeblood of ùïè.

Contrast this with the august New York Times‚Äîa journalistic entity that styles itself as the arbiter of truth, yet publishes only that which aligns with its firmly entrenched worldview. Unlike ùïè, the New York Times does not merely provide a platform for all viewpoints. Rather, it curates, filters, and advances a specific ideological framework, one that has increasingly found its home on the leftward side of the political spectrum. When the Times endorses a candidate, it is not merely engaging in free expression but actively guiding its readership toward a prescribed political outcome, using the authority of its editorial voice to do so.

The inconsistency of the response, then, reveals a deeper anxiety within the establishment. Musk, by endorsing Trump, is seen as a threat not simply because of the endorsement itself, but because he dares to challenge the media gatekeepers who have long assumed the mantle of dictating public discourse. His belief in a candidate who will safeguard ùïè's ability to remain an open forum for speech threatens the very control that institutions like the New York Times have wielded for so long.

At the end of the day, what we are witnessing is not merely a debate over political endorsements but a contest between two visions of public discourse‚Äîone that prizes the free exchange of ideas, and another that seeks to define the limits of permissible opinion. And it is for this reason, I suspect, that Musk‚Äôs endorsement sparks such ire, while the New York Times‚Äô partisan advocacy passes by with nary a raised eyebrow.

"This is Elon Musk's full talk at the rally yesterday in Butler, Pennsylvania. His first true political appearance. 

History was made yesterday in Butler. 

An estimated 80,000+ crowd of dedicated and passionate people who support Donald Trump watched Elon come onto the stage with enthusiasm. 

Elon is happiest when he's sharing his love for people with people, and his jumping was truly a jump for joy, in the purest sense. 

Wearing a black Make America Great hat, Elon said, ""See, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA.""  
Smiling warmly, he continued, ""First of all, I want to say what an honor it is to be here. You know, the true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire.""

‚ÄúThe true test of someone‚Äôs character is how they behave under fire."" 

Elon: ""We had one president who couldn't climb a set of stairs, and another who was fist-pumping after getting shot. FIGHT. FIGHT. FIGHT. Blood coming down the face. America is the home of the brave. 

""There's no truer test than courage under fire. Who do you want representing America? (crowd screams Trump!) Yeah, absolutely! 

""I think this election is the most important election of our lifetime. This is no ordinary election. 

""The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech. 

""They want to take away your right to bear arms. 

""They want to take away your right to vote effectively. You've got 14 states now that don't require voter ID. 

""California, where I used to live, just passed a law banning voter ID for voting. I still can't believe that's real. So, how are you supposed to have a good and proper election if there's no ID? It's just meaningless. 

Free speech is the bedrock of democracy.

Elon: ""And free speech. Free speech is the bedrock of democracy. If people don't know what's going on, if they don't know the truth, how can you make an informed vote? 

You must have free speech in order to have democracy. That's why it is the First Amendment. 

And the Second Amendment is there to ensure that we have the First Amendment. (crowd cheers) 

President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve Democracy in America. This is a must-win situation.""

Vote

Elon continued, 

""I have one ask, for everyone here and for everyone watching this livestream. Just one request, it's very important: Register to Vote. 

""And get everyone you know, and everyone you don't know, drag them to register to vote. There are only 2 days left to register to vote in Georgia and Arizona. 48 hours. Like, text people now. Now. And then make sure they actually do vote. 

""If they don't, this will be the last election. That's my prediction. Nothing is more important. Nothing is more important.""

""So, speaking to people out there in this crowd, you are already convinced. People out there watching the video, watching the livestream, (or reading Gail's article) , you need to get everyone you know, at work, your friends, family, text groups, your social media, everything. 

""Get them to register to vote right now. Only two days left for Georgia and Arizona. Only a couple of weeks left in Pennsylvania. And if they're not registered to vote, it doesn't matter at that point. Register to vote. I'm being repetitive for a reason, okay? So nothing is more important. 

""A lot of people think maybe their vote doesn't count. Well, it does. It matters. This election could be decided by 1000 votes, 500 votes, a tiny margin.""

Elon: ""A lot of people think maybe their vote doesn't count. Well, it does. It matters. This election could be decided by 1000 votes, 500 votes, a tiny margin."" 

Elon also mentioned Trump's website that helps people to register to vote. ""So get everyone you know, to register to vote, at Swamp the Vote (https://t.co/LS8zjpMlha) Double-check that your registration is good, don't take it for granted. I'm just being repetitive about this point because it is the one takeaway, more than anything, that will matter is getting those registrations, and then getting everyone you know to actually vote. 

Elon: ""That is what will decide this election, especially in Pennsylvania. (cheers) 

""So thank you, and honestly, you want to just be a pest. Be a pest to everyone you know, people on the street, everywhere! VOTE, VOTE, VOTE!  FIGHT. FIGHT. FIGHT! VOTE, VOTE, VOTE! Thank you! 

My thoughts
I trust Elon Musk. Elon Musk can be trusted to only do good for the people of the USA. He is a genius technician and a person with a kind heart.
For Elon to take time off from his difficult work at his companies requires a very serious and urgent matter. He is right to put the effort into this urgent election. He's not aiming for his own self-interests, he's making the effort to preserve democracy. I hope that you, dear reader, are going to vote.",2024-10-06 16:39:36+00:00

I had several discussions with people that are pro-Kamala and I was ecstatic as they are intelligent people and I want to understand why they believe what they do.  It's an opportunity to learn.

I tried to find out why they are voting for Kamala by asking a few simple questions.  How do you think she has done as Vice President?  What is her policy that you like the most?  Do you think she is fit to take our country in the right direction?

Their answer.  Orange man bad.

"To @TheDemocrats ,

This is my career suicide note, but it‚Äôs also a thank you from someone who is done with careerism. I‚Äôm a lifelong member of your party and I‚Äôm voting for Donald Trump. Why? It‚Äôs not just your industrial-scale censorship or your endless wars or the fact that you disenfranchised millions of Kennedy voters through lawfare. If that were all I had, it would be sufficient, in terms of conscience and rage, but there‚Äôs more to this story than anger. Your hatred and censorship has taught me to admire @realDonaldTrump and to love my fellow working-class Americans, and for that I thank you.

This vote is for all the traumatized people who have been canceled and banished just for saying no to the establishment. This vote is for the surveyor, the farmer, the HVAC man, the nurse, the hairstylist, the Deadhead, the veteran, and my fellow adjunct professors who have told me their stories about being bullied by the Democrats in their friends and family and their colleagues at work. This is for the young Black woman in my class last year who, on the day of Kamala Harris‚Äôs visit to campus, said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to hate me, Dr. Armstrong, but I‚Äôm not going. I‚Äôm voting for Donald Trump.‚Äù Why would she think I would hate her for the way she votes? What has happened to our country?

Somehow, Donald Trump has changed my mind. Where I once saw a cartoon white supremacist, warmonger, and narcissist, I now see the man who renegotiated NAFTA and the only president in the twenty-first century not to start a new war. Where I once saw the pal of the neocons, I now see a man who has awoken from his slumber and disavowed Dick Cheney, George Bush, and John Bolton, even as my own party embraces these ‚Äúmen.‚Äù

Why has the greatest entrepreneur of my generation (@elonmusk) risked his career to side with Trump? Why has the most consequential grassroots environmentalist of my time (@RobertKennedyJr ) sacrificed friends, family, and reputation to side with ‚ÄúThe Orange Menace?‚Äù Why has the most courageous peace activist of the twenty-first century (@TulsiGabbard) left our party? Because Tulsi, Bobby, and Elon see what I see. Donald Trump is resilient and he‚Äôs risking his life to change the fate of our nation. Trump is transforming the Republican Party into the party of peace, free speech, and the working-class. He has converted George Bush‚Äôs billionaire boys club of Big War, Big Ag, and Big Pharma into a party that cares about public health and embraces regenerative agriculture.

Now I don‚Äôt think the GOP is all the way there yet, but they‚Äôre clearly the party that embraces dissent, and dissent‚Äîbrave speech‚Äîis the fuel for evolution. So, for the first time in my life, I‚Äôm voting Republican. In the name of peace in Ukraine and free speech here at home, I‚Äôm casting my vote, as a Kennedy Democrat, for Donald Trump.

"üö®üá∫üá∏COURT BLOCKS CALIFORNIA LAW ON ""DECEPTIVE"" ELECTION DEEPFAKES

A federal judge has blocked a California law that would have restricted ""materially deceptive"" deepfakes related to elections. 

The judge ruled that the law, AB 2839, likely violates the First Amendment.

The court found the law was overly broad, sweeping in even parody or satire videos that could be considered to ""undermine confidence"" in an election. 

The judge argued this amounted to unconstitutional suppression of political speech.

While the state argued the law targeted legally cognizable harms, the court said it went beyond existing exceptions like defamation. 

The judge stated that ""even deliberate lies"" about the government are protected under the First Amendment.

Ultimately, the court concluded the law failed strict scrutiny, as less restrictive measures like labeling requirements could address the state's concerns.

"‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt yell fire in a crowded theater!‚Äù How many times have you heard advocates of censorship say that? Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz repeated it last night in his debate with Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance.

In so doing, Walz spread misinformation. It‚Äôs not illegal to yell fire in a crowded theater. That‚Äôs a myth. The expression refers to a 1919 Supreme Court opinion superseded by the 1969 Brandenberg v. Ohio decision.

Tim Walz had previously claimed that spreading misinformation about elections was illegal. It‚Äôs not. How could it be? If the government censored disfavored views on elections, how would we ever know if our elections were truly free and fair?

I debunked Walz‚Äôs claim on X last night, and it‚Äôs happily now been viewed over 10 million times.

As satisfying as that is, it‚Äôs still not enough. If Walz and Harris get elected, they may attempt to ramp up the censorship we have been documenting and denouncing. As such, all of us who care about freedom of speech must push ourselves to find ways to persuade our fellow citizens of the benefits of free speech over censorship.

Now, you might not feel like making the case for free speech personally to friends and family, and you certainly don‚Äôt need to.

But many people have emailed me over the last three years expressing dismay at how many Democrats they know are in favor of free speech. I share their dismay. Support among Democrats for government censorship of online misinformation grew from 40% to 70% between 2018 and 2023. It was shocking to testify before Congress on free speech issues last year only to discover how many Democrats wanted more censorship.

And so I made this video for people looking for a way to talk to friends and family about censorship, one of the greatest threats to our democracy.

After working on free speech issues three years ago, I realized that I had taken my support for free speech for granted. I had forgotten that my parents and others had taught me the importance of free speech. It wasn‚Äôt something that came naturally. I still remember when my father explained to me why the Supreme Court let Nazis march through a neighborhood of Holocaust survivors. I remember being shocked by this and thinking such a thing lacked compassion. Only gradually, over several years, I saw the wisdom of free speech, not simply in allowing fundamental human expression but also as the best response to lies and hatred.

That raises a few questions: Will the same approach that worked with me work with people today? Who needs to be persuaded, exactly? And what appears to move them? Over the last few years my colleagues and I have read through the public opinion research, interviewed, and spoken with hundreds of people in the West. One significant finding is that the people in favor of censorship today tend to be more female than male and more on the political Left than Right. And I‚Äôm happy to say that I finally feel confident in explaining what moves them to favor free speech and more opposed to censorship.

The research on support for free speech is mixed. Initially, older adults were more inclined to favor restrictions, but polling by the Pew Research Center shows that this gap has closed. Similarly, a 2022 Knight Foundation survey indicated that younger people, while valuing free speech highly, have become more supportive of limiting online harmful content. However, a recent 2024 survey of Australians found that younger people were more supportive of free speech and against censorship than older people.

The main reason women and people on the left are more supportive of censorship appears to be to reduce harm. This is consistent with the research by psychologists Jonathan Haidt and others that where conservatives tend to hold a broader set of traditional values, progressives have reduced the number of core values they hold strongly to just one: compassion. Earlier research found people on the Left also hold the value of freedom, but it is notably selective, as rising Democratic support for censorship shows.

‚ÄúWomen are more supportive of illegalizing insults of immigrants, homosexualindividuals, transgender individuals, the police, African Americans, Hispanics, Muslims, Jewish people, and Christians, and are more supportive of banning sexually explicit public statements and flag burning,‚Äù noted psychologist Cory Clark in Psychology Today in¬† 2021. ‚ÄúOne likely reason for this pattern is that women are more averse to interpersonal harm and have a relatively stronger concern for protecting others.‚Äù

So, to move people to support free speech, we should first appeal to compassion since it‚Äôs the core value of Democrats, progressives, liberals, and people on the Left today. After you anchor people in compassion, you can make the intellectual case for why free speech is more compassionate than censorship.

This approach is also critical to avoid triggering cognitive dissonance, which is the discomfort individuals feel when they realize they hold contradictory beliefs or are confronted with information that challenges their existing views. If people feel attacked or cornered, they often respond by doubling down on their beliefs to reduce this discomfort, a phenomenon known as ""motivated reasoning"" or ""defensive processing.""

Avoiding accusatory language, empathetic listening, and framing the conversation around shared values can prevent defensive responses and encourage reflection. ‚ÄúIf you must present evidence threatening to the audience‚Äôs worldview,‚Äù wrote a team of psychologists in 2016, ‚Äúyou may be able to reduce the worldview backfire effect by presenting your content in a worldview-affirming manner.‚Äù

Readers of Public may recall what I discovered when interviewing people on the streets of Dublin, Ireland, about free speech. Simply slowing people down and forcing them to engage in ‚Äúslow thinking‚Äù rather than ‚Äúfast thinking‚Äù made them more receptive to free speech arguments. Slowing people down allows them to relax, remember the past, and imagine potential futures. And simply asking questions demonstrates respect and triggers a feeling of obligation by most people to offer truthful answers.

How you approach the topic will depend on whether you‚Äôre talking with a friend or relative or moderating a presidential debate, but it should include affirming shared values. You might say, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a lot of debate about censorship and misinformation. Most of us, myself included, care a lot about protecting vulnerable people and countering bad information while protecting people‚Äôs right to free speech. I‚Äôm curious how you think about these issues, and I wondered if I could ask you how you think about them.‚Äù

Assuming you get permission to go further, here are the three key questions I would recommend...

"Walz Doubles Down on Punishment for Hate Speech, MSM Continues to Ignore It

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz reiterated his belief that ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù isn‚Äôt protected under the First Amendment at last night‚Äôs vice presidential debate.

The remarks came after Trump VP pick JD Vance argued censorship is ‚Äúa much bigger threat to democracy than anything we‚Äôve seen in the last four years,‚Äù drawing a contrast to January 6, which Democrats regularly point to as evidence of Donald Trump‚Äôs danger to democracy.

‚Äú[We do] have a threat to democracy [‚Ä¶] It‚Äôs big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens, and it‚Äôs Kamala Harris saying that rather than debate and persuade her fellow Americans, she'd like to censor people who engage in misinformation.‚Äù Vance said.

‚ÄúYou guys attack us for not believing in democracy,‚Äù he continued, referring to January 6. ‚ÄúBut the most sacred right to the United States democracy is the First Amendment. You yourself have said, ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs no First Amendment right to misinformation‚Äô‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOr threatening. Or hate speech. You can‚Äôt yell fire in a crowded theater‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs the Supreme Court test.‚Äù Walz interjected.

Vance was alluding to comments Walz made in a 2023 MSNBC interview, when he remarked that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no guarantee to free speech on misinformation or hate speech.‚Äù

Video of the interview resurfaced in August shortly after Harris announced Walz as her VP pick. While figures like Glen Greenwald and RFK Jr. were quick to express concern about the clip, others downplayed it by claiming the clip was being taken out of context. The mainstream media seems to have entirely ignored the issue.

Likewise, establishment media has yet to report on Walz‚Äôs comments about hate speech from last night. NPR‚Äôs ‚Äúfact check‚Äù of the debate, for example, dedicates around 2,600 words to fact checking Vance and 200 to Walz. NBC‚Äôs ‚Äú5 key takeaways‚Äù of the debate don‚Äôt mention the exchange or Walz‚Äôs views on free speech. The AP mentions Vance‚Äôs comments about censorship, but not Walz‚Äôs response; instead framing Vance‚Äôs comments as ‚Äúdownplaying January 6.‚Äù

Contrary to Walz‚Äôs statements, there is no ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù exception to the First Amendment. This is supported by well-established Supreme court precedent. R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul struck down an ordinance prohibiting the display of symbols that ‚Äúarouse anger, alarm, or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.‚Äù 2011‚Äôs Snyder v. Phelps ruled that even anti-gay protests by Westboro Baptist Church members staged at armed service members' funerals were protected under the First Amendment. In 2017, the court ‚Äî which included the liberal Ruth Bader Ginsberg ‚Äî unanimously struck down the disparagement clause of the Lanham Act in Simon v. Tam, with Justice Alito writing: ‚ÄúSpeech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express ‚Äòthe thought that we hate‚Äô.‚Äù

The court has treated misinformation similarly. ‚ÄúThe First Amendment creates ‚Äòbreathing space‚Äô protecting the false statements and hyperbole that are ‚Äòinevitable in free debate‚Äô,‚Äù according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. ‚ÄúThe Court has suggested the government may not regulate false ideas, and even false factual statements receive some constitutional protection.‚Äù

Last night‚Äôs vice presidential debate was the first to be held during this election cycle, and likely the last.

"NEW: In a new, heavily redacted DHS Inspector General report, the IG finds that ‚ÄúCBP, ICE, and TSA did not fully assess risks associated w/ releasing noncitizens without ID into the U.S. and allowing them to travel on domestic flights.‚Äù

Key finding: ‚ÄúUnder current processes, CBP and ICE cannot ensure they are keeping high-risk noncitizens without identification from entering the country. Additionally, TSA cannot ensure its vetting and screening procedures prevent high-risk noncitizens who may pose a threat to the flying public from boarding domestic flights.‚Äù¬†

More highlights below üëáüèª

The IG says that according to federal law, ‚Äúnoncitizens without ID are not admissible into the country and ‚Äúshall be detained,‚Äù but that CBP and ICE are permitted to release noncitizens into the U.S. based on various circumstances. 

The report says CBP and ICE accept ‚Äúself reported biographical information, which they use to give migrants immigration forms, who are then able to get on domestic flights, even if they don‚Äôt have ID. 

The IG says he asked DHS for data on the number of noncitizens who did not have ID and were released into the U.S. between fiscal years 2021-2023, but CBP and ICE were unable to provide the data because they don‚Äôt log whether a noncitizen had ID in their databases. The OIG adds that ‚Äúimmigration officers we interviewed acknowledged the risks of allowing noncitizens without ID into the country.‚Äù 

The report finds that the TSA relies on data and background checks on noncitizens from CBP and ICE to determine if someone is a threat, but if that data is incomplete, ‚ÄúTSA‚Äôs methods to screen individuals who pose a threat would not necessarily prevent these individuals from boarding flights.‚Äù 

Additionally, there are heavily redacted portions of the report where TSA conducted assessments on the risks of using the CBP One cell phone app as a screening tool - but the results are not disclosed.

The IG report goes on to say they identified ‚Äúsimilar weaknesses‚Äù in CBP‚Äôs screening processes that allowed ‚Äúhigh risk individuals into the country‚Äù, including someone who was released while being on the FBI Terror Watchlist in 2022 and two Afghans paroled into the U.S. as part of Operation Allies Welcome who may have posed a threat to national security. 

The report concludes: ‚ÄúIf CBP and ICE continue to allow noncitizens - whose identities immigration officers cannot confirm - to enter the country, they may inadvertently increase national security risks.‚Äù

DHS did NOT concur with the IG‚Äôs findings, with both ICE and CBP pushing back. 

DHS says they ‚Äúcannot detain all individuals subject to detention, including inadmissible noncitizens without ID, due to several reasons including a lack of resources (bed space).

ICE said their currently funded detention capacity of 41,500 beds doesn‚Äôt allow them to detain every noncitizen who doesn‚Äôt have ID and valid documents.

CBP said their detention facilities are for ‚Äúshort term‚Äù detention, and they can‚Äôt legally hold noncitizens longer than the law allows, even to mitigate potential risks.

TSA said the report doesn‚Äôt reflect their current policies.

"Yes, we are a nation of laws. But we have *too many* laws, and most of them were never passed by Congress but were instead enacted as federal ‚Äúrules‚Äù by unelected bureaucrats. Dismantling that bureaucracy shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue. In fact, it should be *the most unifying issue* in America, as the following case study reveals:

In 1938, FDR signed a bill creating the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), an ‚Äúindependent agency‚Äù that crushed the life out of the airline industry. If you wanted to start up a new airline, you needed a permission slip from the CAB. The board also decided how much you could charge for a ticket & what routes you were allowed to fly. In 40 years of the CAB‚Äôs existence, not a single new airline opened for business. It was a textbook example of regulatory capture crowding out the competition.

Republican President Gerald Ford got the ball rolling in 1975 when he proposed reducing the CAB's power. Other key players in the anti-CAB movement were Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy, Senate staffer (and future SCOTUS justice) Stephen Breyer, and Jimmy Carter (who replaced Ford in the White House). 

In 1978, the bill abolishing the CAB passed the House 363-8 and passed the Senate 82-4. 

Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch explains what happened next in his new book, ‚ÄúOver Ruled: The Human Toll of Too Much Law‚Äù:

‚Äú[B]etween 1978 and 2011, base ticket prices dropped by almost 40 percent in inflation-adjusted terms. As a result, millions of people flocked to the skies for the first time. An activity that had once belonged largely to elites became one that many Americans take more or less for granted.‚Äù

According to reports in the Brazilian press, on his own authority, Moraes ordered X to delete posts criticizing a Brazilian politician and gave X an unreasonable deadline of only two hours to comply, subject to a daily fine of 100,000 real ($18,000 USD).¬† X complied in good faith by withholding the posts in Brazil the same day.¬†¬†

In response, Moraes fined X not 100,000 real, as his original order had provided, but 700,000 real ($126,000 USD).¬† In his new order, Moraes claimed for the first time that he was fining X 100,000 real per offending post on the X platform, contradicting his own prior order that provided for a total fine of 100,000 real.¬†

X has complied with Brazilian law by withholding the posts in question in Brazil and paying the 100,000 real fine, pending an appeal to the full Supreme Court.¬† Moraes‚Äô attempt to increase the fine to 700,000 real ex post facto and in contradiction with his own prior order represents a clear denial of due process and should be overturned on appeal.¬†

Sentimos a necessidade de comentar sobre a ampla divulga√ß√£o na m√≠dia brasileira das ordens mais recentes do ministro Alexandre de Moraes.¬†¬†

O X cumpriu de boa-f√©, retendo as postagens no Brasil no mesmo dia.¬†¬†

Em resposta, Moraes multou o X n√£o em 100.000 reais, como sua ordem original havia previsto, mas em 700.000 reais ($126.000 USD).¬† Em sua nova ordem, Moraes alegou, pela primeira vez, que estava multando o X em 100.000 reais por post ofensivo na plataforma X, contradizendo sua pr√≥pria ordem anterior que previa uma multa total de 100.000 reais.¬†

O X cumpriu a legisla√ß√£o brasileira ao reter as postagens em quest√£o no Brasil e pagar a multa de 100.000 reais, enquanto aguarda recurso para o plen√°rio do Supremo Tribunal Federal. A tentativa de Moraes de aumentar a multa para 700.000 reais ex post facto e em contradi√ß√£o com sua pr√≥pria ordem anterior representa uma clara nega√ß√£o do devido processo legal e deve ser anulada em recurso.",2024-06-30 20:29:01+00:00
"For those who don't understand what Chevron Deference is, and why SCOTUS ended it, here's the long and short of it:

A family fishing company, Loper Bright Enterprises, was being driven out of business, because they couldn't afford the $700 per day they were being charged by the National Marine Fisheries Service to monitor their company.

The thing is, federal law doesn't authorize NMFS to charge businesses for this. They just decided to start doing it in 2013.

Why did they think they could away with just charging people without any legal authorization?

Because in 1984, in the Chevron decision, the Supreme Court decided that regulatory agencies were the ""experts"" in their field, and the courts should just defer to their ""interpretation"" of the law.

So for the past 40 years, federal agencies have been able to ""interpret"" laws to mean whatever they want, and the courts had to just go with it.

It was called Chevron Deference, and it put bureaucrats in charge of the country.

It's how the OHSA was able to decide that everyone who worked for a large company had to get the jab, or be fired.

No law gave them that authority, they just made it up.

It's how the ATF was able to decide a piece of plastic was a ""machine gun"".

It's how the NCRS was able to decide that a small puddle was a ""protected wetlands"".

It's how out-of-control agencies have been able to create rules out of thin air, and force you to comply, and the courts had to simply defer to them, because they were the ""experts"".

Imagine if your local police could just arrest you, for any reason, and no judge or jury was allowed to determine if you'd actually committed a crime or not. Just off to jail you go.

That's what Chevron Deference was.

It was not only blatantly unconstitutional, it caused immeasurable harm to everyone.

Thankfully, it's now gone.

We haven't even begun to feel the effects of this decision in the courts. It will be used, for years to come, to roll back federal agencies, and we'll all be better of for it.

And that's why politicians and corporate media are freaking out about it.",2024-06-30 20:34:46+00:00
"There‚Äôs a lot of interest in the Supreme Court‚Äôs Loper decision‚Äîand more than a few hot takes out there.

I wanted to offer some thoughts on it as someone who has litigated Chevron cases in private practice and served as the General Counsel and now Commissioner of an agency.

I‚Äôve been on the winning side of cases where I think Chevron made the difference, been on the losing side of some of those same types of cases, and participated in many where I think the outcome would have been the same both before and after Loper.

But there‚Äôs no question that Chevron operated as a heavy thumb on the scale in favor of administrative agencies‚Äîregardless of whether those agencies were adopting new regulatory requirements or eliminating existing ones. 

Though I think it would be fair to say that the lion‚Äôs share of Chevron cases involved challenges to agency decisions that imposed new regulatory requirements on private citizens or businesses.

One threshold point that I think some of the hot takes have missed.  Even before this week‚Äôs decision in Loper, Chevron did not apply to the most significant agency decisions‚Äînamely, those that involve questions of major economic and political significance. 

The major questions doctrine applied in those case, not Chevron.  And the major questions doctrine does not require (indeed, it does not allow) courts to defer to agencies the way Chevron did. Rather, it requires agencies to have a clear congressional authorization to regulate in the manner at issue.

So Loper did not end the application of Chevron deference to agencies in cases that involve major economic and political significance. Courts were already prohibited by the major questions doctrine from applying Chevron deference in those cases.

Turning to Loper itself, the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision focused, in my view, on two core concerns with Chevron.

1.  The Chevron doctrine rested on a fiction.  It required courts to read certain provisions in laws passed by Congress‚Äînamely, provisions that were either silent or ambiguous as to a particular issue‚Äîas if those statutory provisions were something other than silent or ambiguous. Specifically, Chevron created a rule that required courts to treat those silent or ambiguous provisions of law as decisions by Congress to delegate discretionary authority to an administrative agency‚Äîregardless of whether the statute itself contained evidence indicating that Congress intended to provide the agency with that power.

That is not how courts normally read a vague or ambiguous provision of law. Outside the context of administrative law cases governed by Chevron, courts do not take vague and ambiguous statutory provisions and read them as delegations of power. Instead, courts apply traditional tools of statutory interpretation to identify the best reading or meaning of them. Maybe they mean that Congress delegated something, maybe not. Maybe they resolve the relevant question, maybe they have no application to the case at all.

So Loper ends this Chevron fiction. Loper says that courts in administrative law cases must now treat those silent or ambiguous provisions of law the same way courts treat other silent or ambiguous provisions of law passed by Congress. Going forward, then, courts must use ordinary tools of statutory interpretation to identify the best reading of those provisions. Applying those tools of statutory interpretation to silent or ambiguous provisions of law is something that falls within a judge‚Äôs expertise.

None of this means that Congress cannot delegate certain matters to agencies. Indeed, Loper says that Congress can still provide agencies with discretionary authority. But Congress must do so through statutory provisions or language where the best reading of the statute, applying traditional tools of statutory interpretation, is that Congress delegated discretionary authority to the agency, subject to ordinary constitutional constraints. Silence or ambiguity alone no longer requires a court to conclude that Congress delegated authority to an agency.

This is why many commentators view Loper as reinforcing the Framer‚Äôs decision in the Constitution to vest the legislative or law making power in the people‚Äôs representatives in Congress. Loper makes it less likely that courts will find that Congress leaked law making power to administrative agencies without Congress even knowing it. And even less likely that courts will uphold administrative agency decisions that effectively take legislative power from the Article I Branch that Congress never delegated.

2. I think the second problem that the Loper court had with Chevron is that Chevron required courts to adopt permissible readings of statutes, rather than the best reading. In those cases where Chevron courts determined that Congress delegated authority to an agency, the doctrine required courts to agree with an agency‚Äôs interpretation of law‚Äîeven in cases where courts would have concluded, using ordinary tools of statutory interpretation, that the agency‚Äôs interpretation was not the best reading‚Äîprovided that the agency‚Äôs reading was permissible. 

Again, this is not the way courts approach questions of statutory law outside the context of administrative law. As relevant here, courts approach those questions by adopting the best reading of the law.

Commentators have noted that Chevron questions would arise in litigation between two parties‚Äîa private person or company on the one hand and a government agency on the other. In contexts other than administrative law, Chevron did not require a court to accept the permissible reading of a statute when offered by one party in the litigation (the government) even though the other party (the private citizen or business) offered a reading that the court considered to be the best reading of the law.

But Loper does not mean that an agency‚Äôs interpretation of a law it administers is irrelevant when it comes to administrative law cases. Loper makes clear that a court may agree with an agency‚Äôs view that a statutory provision means X even in cases where a court, in the absence of the agency‚Äôs views, might have concluded that the statutory provision means Y.  Going forward, an agency‚Äôs views are likely incorporated into the court‚Äôs analysis as part of the judiciary‚Äôs application of its traditional tools of statutory interpretation.

But again, even before Loper, Chevron did not apply to cases involving questions of major economic or political significance. The Court has required agencies to point to clear congressional authorizations in those cases, not mere silence or ambiguity. So Loper did not end Chevron‚Äôs application to the most significant set of agency decisions.

At bottom, agencies will still win significant cases after Loper, but the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision puts regular people and businesses on a more level playing field with the government when they challenge a regulatory overreach.",2024-06-30 00:14:51+00:00

"DOGE Says Children Received $312M In Loans Meant For Small Businesses During COVID Pandemic | Abril Elfi, One America News

The Department of Government (DOGE) revealed that over $300 million in COVID-19 relief loans were granted to children.

On Sunday, as DOGE continues to root out waste, fraud, and corruption in the federal government, they found thousands of cases where more than $300 million in loans were granted to children.

DOGE reported that the Small Business Administration (SBA) made roughly 5,600 loans totaling $312 million to debtors whose only listed owner was 11 years old or younger at the time of the loan. The loans were made in 2020 and 2021, while the world was dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is unclear what they were for.

‚ÄúWhile it is possible to have business arrangements where this is legal, that is highly unlikely for these 5,593 loans, as they all also used an SSN with the incorrect name,‚Äù the agency wrote.

‚Äú@DOGE and @SBAgov are working together to solve this problem this week,‚Äù they added.

DOGE made the reveal in a post on X on Tuesday, where it also revealed that in 2020 and 2021, the SBA awarded 3,095 loans totaling $333 million to borrowers beyond the age of 115.

The borrowers were still listed as alive in the Social Security database.¬† The bureau reported that in one example, a 157-year-old person acquired $36,000 in loans.¬† The loans consisted of PPP (Paycheck Protection Program) and EIDL (Economic Injury Disaster Loan) loans.

Story shared from Theodore Denney III on FB:

""I own a LOT of cars: including Ferraris (x2), Mercedes, BMW, a very rare C7 ZR1, Cadillac CTS V Coupe, and I lease Teslas for my key employees. Of all the cars I currently own‚Äîand I‚Äôd have to think about how many that is, as I lease space to warehouse most of them‚Äîthe Teslas are by far the best daily drivers. And it‚Äôs not even close. They are fun to drive, have excellent range for an EV (more than enough for my daily needs), full self driving for when i don‚Äôt feel like it, they are good-looking with a form-follows-function aesthetic I respect as a designer and engineer, and their interiors are Scandinavian minimalist, which is also my personal preference.

My first Tesla, a 2015 Model S, racked up nearly 150,000 miles before I was involved in a serious accident where all airbags deployed and the vehicle was utterly destroyed. I walked away with only a sore wrist from the airbag deployment. In many of my other cars‚Äîincluding the Ferrari‚Äôs‚Äîthat accident likely would have taken my life.

Because Teslas are so transformative, and because Elon himself is transformative, those who feel threatened by the change Tesla and Elon bring feel the need to lash out as a means of self-preservation.

"üëÄ Government Contract Waste in Action: A True Story

A software engineer friend shared his experience from a decade-long government contract. On paper, it looked like a cost-saving move‚Äîsix contractors replacing over twenty civil servants. But in reality, a decade was spent rebuilding a software system from scratch... only for the project to be scrapped, and the agency to continue using the original version.

The project cycled through three different contracting companies before being insourced back to the civil service. Actual development took about three or four years. The rest as bureaucratic battles just to get it approved for use.

And the kicker? The small user base (50-100 people, many nearing retirement) didn‚Äôt want a new system. Worse, the new version was slower due to mandatory full logging for debugging. A simple solution‚Äîadding a toggle to disable logging after model verification‚Äîwas rejected.

In the end, the contractors worked in slow motion, thinking they were building something valuable. But after ten years and who knows how many millions spent, it was all for nothing.

Also, according to my friend, contractors are never fired for poor performance. The government just gives the contract to someone else, and the original guys are be eligible to bid for new ones. 

This is how government contract waste happens.",2025-03-06 14:02:09+00:00

"üö®üá∑üá¥EUROPE‚ÄôS TOP RIGHTS COURT BACKS ROMANIAN ELECTION ANNULMENT‚ÄîA SHAM RULING TO PROTECT THE ESTABLISHMENT

The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) just rejected Romanian presidential candidate Calin Georgescu‚Äôs appeal, refusing to overturn the shady annulment of last year‚Äôs election. No real explanation. No accountability. Just a rubber stamp for the elites.

Georgescu won the first round of the November 2024 presidential race against all odds, after surging on TikTok with massive grassroots support. But just days before the second round, Romania‚Äôs Constitutional Court cancelled the entire election, citing vague claims of ""Russian interference""‚Äîwithout clear proof.

Georgescu called it what it was: a coup d'√©tat in disguise. He took the case to Europe‚Äôs highest human rights court, hoping for justice. Instead? A complete dismissal.

The Strasbourg-based court rejected every single argument Georgescu made:

-The right to free elections‚Äîignored
-The right to a fair trial‚Äîdenied
-Freedom of speech, assembly, and association‚Äînot considered
-The right to an effective legal remedy‚Äîthrown out

The court even dismissed his emergency appeal in January, claiming there was ""no imminent risk of irreparable harm."" No irreparable harm? The people of Romania were robbed of their vote!

This isn‚Äôt about Russian influence‚Äîit‚Äôs about controlling the narrative and blocking outsider candidates from challenging the system. The Romanian government, backed by Brussels elites, feared an unpredictable election and used ‚Äúforeign interference‚Äù as an excuse to reset the race.

They have now scheduled a new presidential vote for May, hoping to get a more establishment-friendly outcome.

This is the new playbook: If an outsider wins, cancel the vote. If they fight back, courts will shut them down.

This ruling shows that no election is safe if the ruling class doesn‚Äôt like the result. Free and fair elections mean nothing if courts can erase them on demand.

Last year, Delaware activist Judge Kathaleen McCormick allowed meritless litigation to overturn @elonmusk's compensation package, overruling Tesla's board and 80% of its shareholders.

Instead, Judge McCormick ordered Tesla to pay $345 million in legal fees to attorneys representing a plaintiff who held only nine shares of the company.

In response, major corporations, including Meta, Dropbox, Tripadvisor, Pershing Square, Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and others, have either left Delaware or announced plans to reincorporate elsewhere.

Judge McCormick has extensive ties to President Joe Biden, previously working at Young Conaway, a law firm among Biden‚Äôs top donors, and receiving her judicial nomination from John Carney, one of Biden‚Äôs closest allies.

"EXCLUSIVE:

Are Tesla Takedown organizers getting paid by @elonmusk‚Äôs competitors to short his stock? 

Edward Niedermeyer was the organizer for Event No. 67 in Portland, Oregon yesterday on the Tesla Takedown list compiled by @LoomerUnleashed.

Niedermeyer joined a @Tesla Takedown call alongside Representative Jasmine Crockett @JasmineForUS, a vocal critic of @ElonMusk, to discuss their shared desire to take Tesla down. Edward Niedermeyer has faced accusations of dishonesty and bias against Tesla, stemming from a long history of critical coverage that began in 2008 with his ‚ÄúTesla Death Watch‚Äù series on The Truth About Cars. 

In this series, he predicted Tesla‚Äôs failure during its early Roadster phase, a forecast that proved incorrect as the company thrived. His skepticism persisted, and in 2016, he published an article on https://t.co/RLaviCpK52 titled ‚ÄúTesla Suspension Breakage: It‚Äôs Not The Crime, It‚Äôs The Coverup,‚Äù alleging Tesla concealed Model S suspension issues. This piece triggered a 3% drop in Tesla‚Äôs stock after major media amplified it, though Tesla and Elon Musk later debunked it, noting that 37 of 40 NHTSA suspension complaints were fraudulent, linked to false VINs or locations, and that NHTSA found no safety concerns.

Critics argue Niedermeyer‚Äôs reporting lacks rigor and leans on questionable sources, like Keef Wivaneff, an Australian retiree with a Flickr album of wrecked Teslas and a pattern of filing dubious NHTSA complaints.

Elon Musk has suggested a coordinated effort to tarnish Tesla‚Äôs reputation, questioning Niedermeyer‚Äôs motives given his consistent negativity since 2008.

Niedermeyer‚Äôs professional moves add to the suspicion of his operation. After leaving ‚ÄúThe Truth About Cars‚Äù in 2010, where colleagues continued his critical tone, he joined https://t.co/RLaviCpK52 and founded Argot Industries LLC, a vague entity tied to a WordPress blog while claiming to lead an unnamed startup with an ambiguous ‚Äústrategic communications‚Äù focus. 

This fuels speculation he might serve special interests, possibly tied to Tesla‚Äôs rivals or short-sellers, though no concrete evidence confirms this. His track record, reliance on shaky sources, and the timing of stock-affecting stories paint a picture of an individual with a persistent anti-Tesla agenda, focused on the price of Tesla stock, which begs the question,

Who is paying Niedermeyer to carry out his nearly 2 decade long crusade against Tesla and Tesla stock prices?

As usual, the media is on the attack against Elon. Let‚Äôs debunk some of these headlines:

1. Elon Musk claims to be ‚Äòagainst antisemitism of any kind,‚Äô but has done precious little to prove it - Fortune

Precious little? Since Elon took over, an independent research firm found that ‚Äúmore than 99% of content users and advertisers see on Twitter is healthy,‚Äù and they estimated social media hate speech impressions ‚Äúto be 0.003% compared to Twitter‚Äôs estimate of 0.012%.‚Äù

2. Elon Musk Blames ADL for Destroying Website He Ruined Himself - Rolling Stone

They say Elon destroyed ùïè, yet all the metrics show the platform is breaking records (Monthly Users, User Minutes Per Day, Video Views)

3. Civil rights groups attacked by Elon Musk are mounting a counter-offensive - NBC

'Civil rights groups' üòÇ

4. Elon Musk‚Äôs Latest Target Hits Back - The Atlantic

Ironic how they call Elon the target, when the ADL ADMITTED to pressuring advertisers FOR MONTHS to leave ùïè, dropping advertising revenue by 60%.

@elonmusk finally hits back, yet somehow the ADL became the target and they are hitting back?  üòÇ

Contributors who have already earned a Rating Impact of 5+, or have proven their ability to write helpful notes by earning a Writing Impact of 1+, will maintain the ability to write notes.

"I don't want to spoil anything but at the end of the movie Oppenheimer turns to the camera and says ""I think that the actual catastrophe scenario for AI looks like big advancement in a research lab, maybe driven by them getting a giant venture capital investment and being able to spend 10 times as much on GPUs as they did before, maybe driven by a new algorithmic advance like transformers, maybe driven by hammering out some tweaks in last year's algorithmic advance that gets the thing to finally work efficiently. And the AI there goes over a critical threshold, which most obviously could be like, ‚Äòcan write the next AI‚Äô. That's so obvious that science fiction writers figured it out almost before there were computers, possibly even before there were computers. I'm not sure what the exact dates here are. But if it's better at you than everything, it's better at you than building AIs. That snowballs. It gets an immense technological advantage. If it's smart, it doesn't announce itself. It doesn't tell you that there's a fight going on. It emails out some instructions to one of those labs that'll synthesize DNA and synthesize proteins from the DNA and get some proteins mailed to a hapless human somewhere who gets paid a bunch of money to mix together some stuff they got in the mail in a file. Like, smart people will not do this for any sum of money. Many people are not smart.

The diamondoid bacteria replicate using atmospheric carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sunlight. And a couple of days later, everybody on earth falls over dead in the same second. That's the disaster scenario if it's as smart as I am. If it's smarter, it might think of a better way to do things.

"More than 99% of content users and advertisers see on Twitter is healthy.

And the reach of hate speech on Twitter continues to represent an extremely small fraction of the overall conversation.

This past March, Twitter partnered with Sprinklr to understand, measure and reduce hate speech using its AI-based model and to further our commitment to create a brand-safe environment for our agencies and advertisers.

Today we‚Äôre sharing an update that includes all of April and May 2023.

Sprinklr‚Äôs independent model continues to show the reach of daily English-language hate speech impressions is even lower than Twitter‚Äôs own model estimates.

Sprinklr estimates the average daily number to be 0.003% compared to Twitter‚Äôs estimate of 0.012% for the period of January 1, 2023 to May 31, 2023. Additionally, we estimate hate speech impressions are 30 percent lower on average vs. pre-acquisition.

In June we significantly expanded our Freedom of Speech, Not Reach policy enforcement, which dramatically reduces impressions on harmful content. And all indicators for June and July show sustained progress.

Our work is ongoing and we‚Äôre proud of the progress we‚Äôre making in maintaining a healthy global town square that is open for everyone to be themselves.",2023-07-18 20:26:34+00:00

"This is absolutely the MOST IMPORTANT thing said today during the meeting with Elon Musk and Donald Trump

Listen to EVERY WORD:

Elon Musk ‚ÄúIf there's not a good feedback loop from the people to the government. And if you have rule of the bureaucrat or if the bureaucracy is in charge, then what meaning does democracy actually have?

If the people cannot vote and have their will be decided by their elected representatives in the form of the president and the Senate and the house, then we don't live in a democracy. We live in a bureaucracy.

So it's incredibly important that we close that feedback loop. We fix that feedback loop and that the public, the public's elected representatives, the president, the house and the Senate decide what happens as opposed to an a large unelected bureaucracy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can't have an autonomous federal bureaucracy. You have to have one that is responsive to the people. That's the whole point of a democracy.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you asked, looked at the founders today and said, what do you think of the way things have turned out?

Well‚Ä¶ what we have this unelected, fourth unconstitutional branch of, of government, which is the bureaucracy, which has in a lot of ways currently more power than any elected representative.‚Äù

Completely logical. We need huge reform.",2025-02-12 07:25:13+00:00
"Tonight, Rachel Maddow led her show with a hit piece against the Cybertruck & Elon, suggesting the proposed $400M for armored Teslas was an example of ""self-dealing.""

Yet she conveniently left out that the procurement list was revised in Dec 2024, when Biden was President. The Tesla line item was last modified on December 13, 2024.

Unfortunately, because Rachel entirely left out this important context, many of her 1.7 million nightly viewers will believe her misleading narrative.

SpaceX wins their government contracts because they offer the lowest price and execute. It‚Äôs not a bad thing to serve the U.S. government with great capability and products at a low price relative to the competition.

Tesla is the most American-made auto manufacturer in the U.S. Every Tesla sold in America is built in America. When you buy a Tesla, you are supporting American industry. Teslas have a lower cost of ownership compared to ICE cars. The government would likely save money buying armored Teslas instead of armored ICE cars, based on what we‚Äôve seen with long local law enforcement trials.",2025-02-13 03:30:19+00:00

It's very transparent: They went to the systems, they actually saw the payments and the payments were going out to crazy shit.

- Require that all outgoing government payments have a payment categorization code, which is necessary in order to pass financial audits. This is frequently left blank, making audits almost impossible.

- All payments must also include a rationale for the payment in the comment field, which is currently left blank. Importantly, we are not yet applying ANY judgment to this rationale, but simply requiring that SOME attempt be made to explain the payment more than NOTHING!

- The DO-NOT-PAY list of entities known to be fraudulent or people who are dead or are probable fronts for terrorist organizations or do not match Congressional appropriations must actually be implemented and not ignored. Also, it can currently take up to a year to get on this list, which is far too long. This list should be updated at least weekly, if not daily.

The above super obvious and necessary changes are being implemented by existing, long-time career government employees, not anyone from @DOGE. It is ridiculous that these changes didn‚Äôt exist already!

"Excessive Immigration Hurts Birthrates
When migration overwhelms the housing supply, fertility plummets

Housing costs are a big barrier to having kids in the US and other countries. Where immigration exceeds the ability to add housing, young people are priced out.

The building industry can‚Äôt keep up
Immigration can bring a lot of benefits, but there are also costs, and housing shortages are often one of them. Housing limitations are a big reason why excessively high immigration rates are not feasible. The housing stock of a country increases gradually, but immigration can overwhelm housing suddenly. @ElonMusk explained the problem back in January:

Housing shortages related to very high immigration are already occurring in the United States. Even though US fertility has been below replacement for 50 years, there aren't enough houses for families that want them.

House Affordability is a Causal Factor for Birthrates
The relationship between housing affordability and fertility rates has been well established in numerous studies. This can easily be seen among US states. Where homes are more affordable in relation to incomes, fertility is higher.

When homes are too expensive, young people are often stuck living with their parents. As demographer Lyman Stone showed in a study across many countries for the Institute of Family Studies, when young couples live with their parents, they tend to have far fewer children.

For fertility, it is crucial for young people to start living independently early in adulthood, but this is very hard to do when there is a housing shortage.

The Case of Canada
Canada offers a cautionary tale of what happens when immigration overwhelms the housing supply. No country in the world has higher net-migration per capita than Canada.

Meanwhile, fertility in Canada has plummeted to just 1.25 births per woman in 2023, meaning Canada has by far the lowest fertility among Anglosphere countries and one of the lowest fertility rates in the world. Why is fertility in Canada suddenly so low?

The lack of sufficient housing is surely a big reason. Home prices have tripled just since 2000, and housing has become the top political issue in Canada, pushing a generation of young people to the right.

Making matters worse, much of the housing being built in Canada is small apartments in high-rise towers. These are generally anti-natal. Canada really needs more of the single-family homes most sought after by people wanting children. The supply of those is much harder to increase.

While falling fertility in Canada has multiple causes, the immigration-driven housing crisis is a big one. Canada is an extreme case, but this effect is seen in other countries too. In New Zealand, which has the second highest per-capita migration rates, fertility fell from 2.0 to 1.5 since 2015. In the UK, it fell from 1.77 to 1.43 over the same time period. In these cases too, immigration-led housing shortages seem to be a major part of the story.

What about East Asia
What about East Asian countries like Korea, China and Japan? They have very little immigration and yet have extremely low birthrates. Don't they undermine this argument?

First, low fertility has multiple drivers. A range of factors have an impact including cultural ones, and it is a mistake to distill birthrates down to just one cause. But second, within-country migration is massive in these countries, contributing to a similar housing dynamic locally.

Even though Korea, China and Japan are all depopulating and have low international immigration, they have extremely high rates of migration from rural areas to a few fashionable cities. The result is similar: young adults are priced out of housing and end up living with their parents, or else they live in tiny apartments. Fertility is exceptionally low in cities like Seoul, Shanghai and Tokyo, compared to the respective countries as a whole.

Everyone can‚Äôt live in the same place
When everyone tries to move to the same places, whether within countries or across borders, it is negative for birthrates by creating both crowding and local housing shortages. From a fertility perspective, geographic dispersion is much more pro-natal.

One of the great challenges for solving the global fertility crisis is figuring out how to have economic dynamism that is geographically spread out across many regions and countries. Networked communication can help. The economic benefits of migration will be short-lived if birthrates are so low.

"ELECTION INTEGRITY: It‚Äôs truly something that Senator Raphael Warnock is more concerned about the accuracy of a hand count than the results churned out by Dominion Voting Machines. His fear? That a hand count could show Trump won Georgia, while the Dominion machines show Kamala Harris as the victor, leading to the state refusing to certify Harris's win. This isn‚Äôt just a hypothetical concern‚ÄîWarnock is suggesting that hand counts could reveal discrepancies, and apparently, that‚Äôs a problem. But shouldn‚Äôt the goal be to ensure the candidate who gets the most votes actually wins, regardless of the method?

Let‚Äôs break this down. Each precinct in Georgia is responsible for hand-counting around 1,900 ballots within a five-hour window. That‚Äôs hardly an insurmountable task. It‚Äôs actually a highly manageable one that ensures the vote tallies reported by Dominion machines are accurate. If these machines are as flawless as their defenders claim, then what‚Äôs the harm in double-checking? A hand count would only serve to confirm the machines‚Äô accuracy, wouldn‚Äôt it?

Warnock seems to believe that a hand count showing a different outcome would cause chaos. But here‚Äôs the solution: if discrepancies are found that could alter the election outcome, those ballots can‚Äîand should‚Äîbe hand-counted again, as many times as needed, to ensure the most accurate results. That's how you ensure that the true will of the voters is reflected, not through blind trust in machines but through verification when needed.

So, why the resistance to hand counts? If the machines and hand counts match up, great‚Äîeveryone wins. But if they don't, it‚Äôs democracy doing its job‚Äîcatching errors and correcting course. The real question here is: why is Senator Warnock so worried about verifying the results? Could it be that some are afraid the hand count might not align with the narrative they‚Äôre pushing?",2024-09-23 16:45:29+00:00
"a san francisco voter guide for people who aren‚Äôt insane

San Francisco should be the greatest city in the world, and that‚Äôs the goal. But before we get to all the fun shit ‚Äî¬†new tunnels and trains up your ass, rooftop hydroponic gardens of genetically-modified flora, every building in the city zoned to seven stories (provided it is beautiful (we all know what is, and what is not, beautiful)), 24-hour clubbing in the foggy neon ‚Äúmidnight district,‚Äù promotions and raises for whoever is managing the city parks (you guys are doing a great job actually, thank you), and a colossal ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù statue on Alcatraz Island to match New York City‚Äôs Lady Liberty ‚Äî¬†we need to claw our way back to base-level human civilization.

Namely: crime should be illegal, emergency shelter should be built for the homeless, that emergency shelter should be prioritized over free one-bedroom apartments for drug addicts who just moved to the city, NGOs grifting city dollars in the name of improving a social problem they invariably make worse should be starved of funding, public schools should be safe and clean, public transportation should be solvent, and the budget should be balanced. Things, in other words, should just be normal.

At various points we have termed this philosophy of government ‚Äúduh,‚Äù ‚Äúyeah no shit,‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat if things just worked?‚Äù Over time, the philosophy has become more popular, and today adherents of this radical perspective on local government functioning in a manner that is not, technically speaking, terroristic in nature‚Ä¶ are legion. This is a voter guide for you ‚Äî¬†people who aren‚Äôt insane. Accept no substitutions.

Basic breakdown of the guide looks like this: first, we provide a cheat sheet with every answer, one after the other, for easy cribbing in your polling booth.

For example, we now know that the Springfield city manager has acknowledged complaints about pets being eaten. As far back as March, there are videos of him talking about the complaints."" 

""You can say you don't believe those stories or whatever, but those reports were real. But David Muir fact-checked in real-time, saying that Trump was wrong, and there was an effort to gaslight and make him sound crazy during the debate when there were, in fact, sources for what he was saying.""

""And they only fact-check one candidate. For example, when Kamala Harris repeated numerous hoaxes like the Very Fine People hoax, the Bloodbath hoax, and the Suckers and Losers hoax. I mean, these are things that were already addressed in the last debate. And, you know, even left-wing sites like Snopes have said the Very Fine People thing is totally made up.

And you're going to get a ton of people who are going to sue you, just for the hell of it, basically.

California's going to need a crisis to have deregulation and delitigation.

The two entities that most control the Democratic Party are the unions and, secondarily, the plaintiff bar, basically, the lawyers that sue, especially class action. That's who controls the Democratic Party.

Anyone who's familiar with the inside baseball of this will agree with me. This is, in fact, the case, especially in California.

So, the issue is that the lawyers write the legislation to make it easy to win lawsuits in California because they funded the election of the officials. The people who got elected got funded by Democrats and lawyers.

So, then they write the legislation to make it easy to win lawsuits and get gigantic awards because they got the people elected.

"Here is the oldest trick in the journalism playbook: refusing to ask questions on email or get back written, thoughtful responses. 

They want to talk ‚Äúon background‚Äù in person or on the phone. When they do this they build trust in order to get you to spill the beans on your friends, colleagues and industry. 

They can take five of these background calls, write ‚Äúnotes‚Äù that they show to their editors as ‚Äúproof.‚Äù 

They can then craft whatever story they want with disclaimer you read that say: ‚Äúthree folks who preferred to be off the record for fear of BLANK said BLANK.‚Äù 

I know this trick, because when I was in journalism it was explicitly explained to me by former Nytimes, WSJ and magazine reporters. 

If you want to protect yourself simply say to them ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to answer questions over email and off the record.‚Äù

They will then leave out all the fluffy questions ‚Äî even 99% of your total words ‚Äî to simply get the one ‚Äúoff the cuff‚Äù response you give them at the end.

".@elonmusk (worth $250B) answers why he‚Äôs still working:

I think it's a good question you asked, because it goes to, like, at a foundational level, what is my philosophy, and why does it lead to this conclusion?

So the reason is that when I was a teenager, I had, like, an existential crisis to try to figure out what's the meaning of life. There doesn't seem to be any meaning. For me, at least the religious texts, and I read all of them that I could get my hands on did not seem convincing. Then I started reading the philosophers.

Be careful of reading German philosophers as a teenager. It's definitely not going to help with your depression. So reading Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, as an adult, it's much more manageable. But as a kid, you're like, ‚ÄúWhoa.‚Äù

So then I was like, ‚ÄúMan, I'm just struggling to find meaning in life here.‚Äù And then I read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. And basically what Douglas Adams was saying is that we don't really know what the right questions are to ask. The question is not, ‚ÄúWhat's the meaning of life?‚Äù

In The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Earth it turns out is a big computer, and its goal is to answer the question, ‚ÄúWhat's the meaning of life?‚Äù And Earth comes up with the answer ‚Äú42‚Äù. This is where the 42 number comes from. And 420 is just ten times 42.

In that book, which is really sort of a book about, it's an existential philosophy book disguised as humor. They come to the conclusion that, no, the real problem is trying to formulate the question. And to really have the right question, you need a much bigger computer than Earth.

And so maybe one way, I think, of characterizing this would be to say, ‚ÄúThe universe is the answer. What is the question? Or what are the questions?‚Äù

The more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, the better we can understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. The more we can expand consciousness, become a multi-planet species, ultimately a multistellar species‚Ä¶ we have a chance of figuring out what the hell is going on.

And so this is why I think we should have more humans and both biological and digital consciousness. And why we should become a multi-planet species and a multistellar species is so that we can understand the nature of the universe.

And then in order for that to occur, then we have to make sure that things are good on Earth. We don't want Earth to disappear, so sustainable energy is important.",2024-09-18 10:00:22+00:00

"NEW: Per newly released CBP data, nearly 530,000 migrants have flown into the US & have been paroled into the country as part of the Biden administration‚Äôs controversial CHNV mass parole program. Additionally,  approx 813,000 migrants have scheduled appointments via the CBP One app at ports of entry to be released into the US.

These are ‚Äúlawful pathways‚Äù created by the Biden administration, and these numbers do not count in Border Patrol data, as they are not illegal crossings. 

Most of the migrants taking part in these programs are paroled into the U.S. on two year humanitarian parole grants, which also allow them to apply to work. 

Every single ICE source/contact I‚Äôve spoken with has told me the same thing - they do not have the manpower or resources to find and deport such a large population of people if they overstay these 2 year grants. 

As it stands now, ICE‚Äôs non-detained docket is on track to hit 8 million by the end of the year, and each ICE officer currently manages an average of 7,000 cases. The agency is already tasked with tracking down and removing those with final orders of removal, aggravated felons, gotaways, etc. They physically do not have the bodies to track and remove this additional population - and there has been no government agency monitoring parole expiration, according to a recent DHS Inspector General report. 

The bottom line - the more than 1 million migrants the Biden admin has allowed into the U.S. via these programs are here to stay - even if they fall out of status and become unlawfully in the U.S.

"Elon Musk: Extending life to multiple planets would be one of the most important milestones, not only in the history of humanity, but in the history of life itself.

""I think space is extremely important.

But first, you have to go to the definition of importance and say, why is anything important?

And if you use the lens of history, and you zoom out far, I think you can distinguish the less important from the more important.

If you zoom out really far and look at the 4-billion-year history of Earth and the evolution of life itself and say, what are the major milestones in the evolution of life itself?

Obviously, there's single-celled life, multicellular life, there's differentiation of plants and animals, there's life going from the oceans to land, there's mammals and consciousness.

There's maybe a half-dozen or so really big milestones in the history of life.

And I think on that scale, would also fit the expansion of life to multiple planets.

It would be at least as important as life going from the oceans to land, and arguably more important because if you're going from oceans to land and got a lot uncomfortable on the land, you could jump back in the water.

But that's not something you could do with going to another planet.

In fact, I think extending life to multiple planets really requires consciousness as a precursor.

So, if we've got something that's so important that it'd be one of the half dozen or so most important milestones in the history of life itself, that's pretty darn important.

And it goes beyond the parochial concerns of humanity.

It's something that is of importance to life in general.

So, that's why I think it's important to do and this is the first time in the 4-billion-year history of Earth that it's been possible.

How long will it remain possible?

I mean, if things go well, obviously it will be possible for a long time, but if something unfortunate were to happen, that tiny window that just opened for the first time in 4 billion years could close.

I'm actually an optimist, so I actually think that things will go fairly well on Earth.

And this is not to suggest complacency, because there are very important issues, the climate being probably number one in terms of earthly issues.

But I think if this is the first time in 4 billion years that life has had the possibility of doing that, we should take advantage of that, of that little window.

And just in case it does close.

Because extending to multiple planets gives us the surest chance of life lasting for a very long time.

Because there's always the possibility, of some either natural disaster or potentially man-made disaster, that extinguishes life.

And that would be bad.""

Send links from X directly to your friends, with text, or email, or whatever other messaging program.",2024-09-15 05:15:42+00:00
"Here are some general tips I have if you‚Äôre a smaller account and would like to grow. They may not apply to everyone:

‚Ä¢ Subscribe to X Premium: Accounts with blue checkmarks are automatically pushed to the top of the reply section. If you don‚Äôt have that blue check, people are much less likely to see your comments, especially larger accounts that get a lot of comments under their posts.

‚Ä¢ Reply to bigger accounts: One of the best strategies to reach that 5M impression threshold to become eligible for ad revenue is to sort of become a reply guy. If you‚Äôre one of the first to reply under a big account, it‚Äôs much more likely that your reply will be seen by a lot of people. I can‚Äôt begin to tell you how many people have turned on notifications for my account (and others' accounts) and are the first ones to comment under posts. This has resulted in nearly all of them becoming eligible for ad revenue and boosted their overall follower counts.

‚Ä¢ Niche: While this doesn‚Äôt apply to everyone, focusing on a niche with your content means people know what to expect when they go to your account.

‚Ä¢ Keep it civil: Nobody likes a complainer or someone who frequently insults/attacks people. People won‚Äôt want to engage with you. It might help you get some clicks here and there, but it‚Äôs not a good long-term strategy. It‚Äôs a turn-off.

‚Ä¢ Be consistent: One of the biggest mistakes I see smaller accounts make is that they give up too early. I started with 300 followers. I have posted Tesla/EV news for 4.5 years straight, 7 days per week. I still do, but I post on average 75% less than I did a couple of years ago, yet my impressions haven‚Äôt dropped. The Tesla community is 50x bigger now than when I started, so it's much easier to grow now. If people know your account produces a certain type of content, they‚Äôll add you to lists on X, search your name more often, etc. Don't give up.

‚Ä¢ Keep things simple: If most people can‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre saying, they won‚Äôt engage with you.

‚Ä¢ Algorithm: Sometimes the algo can be your best friend, and sometimes it can feel like it‚Äôs working against you. Don‚Äôt overthink it. Just stay focused on what you do best and keep posting content people find interesting.

‚Ä¢ Spaces: Frequently talking on X Spaces can actually bring you a lot of new followers if you have interesting things to say, and larger accounts will start to recognize you more and be more inclined to engage with you.

‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt engage with haters: I used to do this a lot in the early days. What can I say? I was new to the game lol. But it never ended with any sort of resolution, was a huge waste of time, and the people that came to my account for news had no interest in any beef I might have had with another account. Now, I ignore 99.9% of it.

‚Ä¢ Visuals: Most people on social media have short attention spans. Grabbing their attention with high-quality visuals can help a lot.

‚Ä¢ No Chat GPT/Grok replies: The number of people that use Chat GPT/Grok to come up with replies is insane. You can immediately tell AI wrote it, so don‚Äôt do it. Be unique and come up with your own words. Using Chat GPT/Grok for punctuation and grammar fixes is fine.

‚Ä¢ Anonymous accounts: If people know your real name and face, your account is likely to do better, and people will trust you more.

‚Ä¢ Be yourself: If you try to be something you‚Äôre not, people will sniff that out.

‚Ä¢¬†Formatting: I see a lot of people format their posts in a way that makes everything look like a mess. Use bullet points, paragraph breaks, etc. You ideally want a clean look.

I'm sure I'll think of other tips later that aren't listed above, but I hope this helps a little. Some of these tips are obvious, but are worth reiterating.",2024-09-15 04:54:31+00:00

7 U.S. soldiers were injured as more than 200 troops from both the U.S and Iraq, including elite Army Rangers backing up the main assault force, hunted down fighters in bunkers over miles of remote terrain.

The operation led to the deaths of 14 insurgents, including Abu Ali al-Tunisi, one of the most significant bomb makers for ISIS.

"Polaris Dawn Flight Day 3 Update

Early Thursday morning at 7:58 a.m. ET, the Polaris Dawn crew successfully completed the world‚Äôs first spacewalk ‚Äì also known as an extravehicular activity (EVA) ‚Äì from Dragon at 732.2 km above Earth.¬†
¬†
Shortly after arriving in space on Tuesday, the crew began a two-day pre-breathe process, designed to prevent decompression sickness while also preparing the crew for the environment inside the EVA suits by gradually lowering Dragon‚Äôs cabin pressure and increasing the oxygen concentration.¬†
¬†
Then on Thursday,¬†the crew donned their suits and initiated Dragon seat rotation, suit tare, and the heads-up display and helmet camera checkouts.¬†The 106-minute spacewalk officially began at 6:12 a.m. ET when suit pressurization started, the nitrogen purge was initiated, and pure oxygen (O2) was flowing into the suits. A secondary flow of oxygen primarily helped provide cooling to the suits, which would come in handy during the spacewalk.¬†
¬†
Once suit leak checks were complete, the crew and ground teams gave the go for Dragon to initiate venting, which took the cabin‚Äôs pressure down from¬†~8 psi to below 1 psi ‚Äì nearly to the vacuum of space. Simultaneously, Dragon repositioned its trunk to face the sun ahead of the hatch opening.¬†
¬†
Mission Commander Jared Isaacman opened the hatch and for the first time, four astronauts were simultaneously exposed to the vacuum of space. Jared and Mission Specialist Sarah Gillis separately exited the spacecraft and individually performed a series of suit mobility demonstrations to¬†test the performance of the spacesuit in the vacuum environment of space. Mission Pilot Kidd Poteet and Mission Specialist Anna Menon remained seated, managing suit umbilicals and monitoring vital support systems and telemetry on Dragon‚Äôs displays.
¬†
Upon completion of their individual EVAs, the hatch was closed, Dragon re-pressurized to 14 psi, cabin oxygen and pressure levels confirmed, officially completing the suit testing alongside the first commercial spacewalk and the first EVA from a Dragon spacecraft.
¬†
Throughout the EVA, stunning visuals were afforded by Dragon‚Äôs cameras and the spacesuits¬†helmet cameras as the crew orbited between 184.9 x 732.2 km above Earth.
¬†
Following the spacewalk, the crew took time to rest and recuperate, enjoying a well-deserved meal¬†before posting from space for the first time on X using Starlink high-speed internet.¬†The crew concluded the day by connecting with their families and settling in for their sleep period ahead of Flight Day 4.",2024-09-12 20:35:13+00:00

"FACT CHECK: In last night's three-on-one debate the ABC News moderators used misleading crime data from the FBI to 'fact check' @realDonaldTrump. The reality is that Trump (as he usually is) was right - crime is not down - it is up, way up. 

Kamala Harris and her willing accomplices in the mainstream media would have you believe that violent crime in America is at a 50-year low, a narrative eagerly parroted by so-called fact-checkers at Politifact and now ABC News. The reality, however, is far from what they claim. The only thing at a 50-year low is the integrity of violent crime data. Less than a year after taking office, Biden-Harris's administration had the FBI dismantle the long-standing crime reporting system, replacing it in 2021 with a new, 'woke' system that is optional for state and local law enforcement agencies to use. As a result, at least 6,000 law enforcement agencies aren't providing data, meaning that 25% of the country's crime data is not captured by the FBI. This deliberate underreporting skews the statistics, painting a falsely optimistic picture of public safety while real Americans continue to suffer from rising crime rates.

Democrat-controlled cities from New York to San Francisco have effectively decriminalized violent crime. For instance, in New York City, 52% of violent felony cases are downgraded to misdemeanors, and offenders are typically offered diversion agreements that keep these offenses out of crime statistics. This manipulation alone could account for a 50% or more drop in reported violent crimes in the Big Apple. Across the country, Soros-backed prosecutors are refusing to prosecute violent criminals or downgrading their charges in record numbers. This systematic underreporting and leniency are tactics used by Democrats to create a misleading narrative about public safety, while communities continue to suffer from unchecked crime.

It's not far-fetched to imagine that the Biden-Harris regime and the Democrats replaced the FBI's universal crime data system with a new optional system to fabricate this massive decrease in 'reported' crime. The move raises serious questions about their motives and the integrity of the data.

Of course, the Democrats will argue that the new system is more inclusive, allowing law enforcement agencies to record pronouns and gender identities, including transgender and nonbinary, as well as the sexual preferences of both criminals and victims. The timing and optional nature of the new system suggest an ulterior motive: to obscure the real rise in crime and present a false narrative of improvement under Democratic leadership.

Additionally, we know that the 70 Soros-backed prosecutors, representing 72 million Americans and half of the nation's 50 most populous cities and counties, have made it their mission to implement so-called restorative justice. This approach often means refusing to prosecute violent criminals based on factors such as race and gender identity. The few criminals they do prosecute almost always have their violent felonies downgraded to misdemeanors. Both of these realities‚Äîthe new optional reporting system and the restorative justice efforts‚Äîhave led to violent crime data that fails to reflect the true state of our communities since 2021. These manipulations distort public perception and allow Democrats to promote a false sense of security.

National polls reveal that most Americans believe crime has increased significantly over the past four years. The situation is even more dire in large Democrat-controlled cities, where almost all residents report a massive surge in crime. Most residents even report that they or someone in their family has been a victim of crime.

Take Chicago, for example. Every weekend, approximately 70 people are shot. The crisis has escalated to such an extent that the mayor recently canceled the city's contract with a company that detects and reports gunfire. There are so many gunshots in Chicago that police can only respond if someone is actually hit by a bullet.

New York City is similarly experiencing a huge spike in robberies and assaults, often occurring in broad daylight. The situation became so severe this year that the governor had to deploy National Guard troops to the NYC subway system to deter criminals. Before District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Attorney General Letitia James took office, these violent crimes would have been prosecuted as felonies. Now, if they are prosecuted at all, they are often downgraded to misdemeanors with diversion deals.

There is also ample evidence that the FBI and the Biden-Harris regime are simply cooking the books. Watch Jesse Waters expose what he calls Enron-style corruption in their crime reporting. 

The next time someone tries to tell you that Biden and Harris have reduced crime to its lowest levels in 50 years, let them know the truth. It's easy to claim a decrease in crime when you leave out data from 25% of the population living in major cities like Los Angeles and New York City.

The reality is, these omissions paint a misleading picture of the state of crime in America. Don't let them gaslight you with manipulated statistics. Demand full transparency and accountability in crime reporting to get the real story.",2024-09-11 12:25:04+00:00

"This clip may be the most egregious example of ABC debate moderators' direct actions/inactions to affect viewers‚Äô perceptions of the information presented at the debate.

There are at least seven instances of this within a two-minute span.

This is not ‚Äúbias.""

It‚Äôs much worse.

This is direct, planned interference in the debate outcome. When moderators take on the role of ‚Äúfact checkers"" the inference is that the absence of a ‚Äúfact check‚Äù confers validity to the non-fact-checked information.

When one side is repeatedly ‚Äúfact checked,‚Äù while the other is not, that is a signal to the viewer that one side is not reliable and truthful, while the other side is.

The ABC moderators had their orders, and here you see those orders executed.

In this clip:

1) Trump says Pelosi is responsible for security at the Capitol. True. Muir intervenes on Kamala‚Äôs behalf by cutting him off with snarky retort, doesn‚Äôt acknowledging the validity of Trump‚Äôs statement, and immediately redirects to Kamala to set up her ‚Äúanswer"" he knows is coming. This is direct action by Muir to affect the outcome of this exchange.

2) Kamala says she was at the Capitol on J6. She was there in the morning, but left to go to DNC HQ prior to the riot. Critical information is omitted. No fact-check.

3) Kamala says Trump incited a mob to attack the Capitol. False. Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúpeacefully and patriotically‚Äù comments are ignored. Trump is not charged with inciting violence. No fact check.

4) Kamala says that ‚Äúsome"" police officers died on January 6. False. No fact check.

5) Kamala recites the Charlottesville ‚ÄúFine People‚Äù hoax. This has been thoroughly and repeatedly debunked. No fact check.

6) Kamala recites the ‚Äústand back and stand by‚Äù hoax. This is designed to infer that Trump was ordering a ‚Äúmilitia‚Äù to act on later orders, when he was clearly asking for a cooling of tensions. No fact check.

7) Kamala recites the ‚Äúbloodbath"" hoax. Trump was talking about the automobile industry, not violence. No fact check.

Because none of that even matters. It was never about the damn cat. The truth is: 
-the US Federal Government flew / bussed in 20,000 Haitians refugees to a small Republican county in Ohio of only 50,000. Now, those migrants make up almost 30% of the Springfield population & are overwhelming their limited resources

""Across different metrics, a wide gap in GDP has opened up between the EU and the US, driven mainly by a more pronounced slowdown in productivity growth in Europe. Europe‚Äôs households have paid the price in foregone living standards. On a per capita basis, real disposable income has grown almost twice as much in the US as in the EU since 2000.""

""First ‚Äì and most importantly ‚Äì Europe must profoundly refocus its collective efforts on closing the innovation gap with the US and China, especially in advanced technologies. Europe is stuck in a static industrial structure with few new companies rising up to disrupt existing industries or develop new growth engines. In fact, there is no EU company with a market capitalisation over EUR 100 billion that has been set up from scratch in the last fifty years, while all six US companies with a valuation above EUR 1 trillion have been created in this period. This lack of dynamism is self-fulfilling.""

""There are not enough academic institutions achieving top levels of excellence and the pipeline from innovation into commercialisation is weak. [...] However, while the EU boasts a strong university system on average, not enough universities and research institutions are at the top. Using volume of publications in top academic science journals as an indicative metric, the EU has only three research institutions ranked among the top 50 globally, whereas the US has 21 and China 15.""

""Regulatory barriers to scaling up are particularly onerous in the tech sector, especially for young companies. Regulatory barriers constrain growth in several ways. First, complex and costly procedures across fragmented national systems discourage inventors from filing Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), hindering young companies from leveraging the Single Market. Second, the EU‚Äôs regulatory stance towards tech companies hampers innovation: the EU now has around 100 tech-focused laws and over 270 regulators active in digital networks across all Member States. Many EU laws take a precautionary approach, dictating specific business practices ex ante to avert potential risks ex post. For example, the AI Act imposes additional regulatory requirements on general purpose AI models that exceed a pre-defined threshold of computational power ‚Äì a threshold which some state-of-the-art models already exceed. Third, digital companies are deterred from doing business across the EU via subsidiaries, as they face heterogeneous requirements, a proliferation of regulatory agencies and ‚Äúgold plating‚Äù of EU legislation by national authorities. Fourth, limitations on data storing and processing create high compliance costs and hinder the creation of large, integrated data sets for training AI models. This fragmentation puts EU companies at a disadvantage relative to the US, which relies on the private sector to build vast data sets, and China, which can leverage its central institutions for data aggregation. This problem is compounded by EU competition enforcement possibly inhibiting intra-industry cooperation. Finally, multiple different national rules in public procurement generate high ongoing costs for cloud providers. The net effect of this burden of regulation is that only larger companies ‚Äì which are often non-EU based ‚Äì have the financial capacity and incentive to bear the costs of complying. Young innovative tech companies may choose not to operate in the EU at all.""

Milei's aggressive cuts in public spending, deregulation, and currency stabilization have led to fiscal surpluses and reduced inflation.

Despite previous concerns about his libertarian policies, Milei‚Äôs leadership has strengthened Argentina's economic and international standing, while rejecting alliances with blocs like BRICS.

"Brazil‚Äôs decisions to ban X and freeze Starlink assets are part of a growing crackdown on free speech.  But they also violates Brazil‚Äôs own laws.

Today, I wrote my regulatory counterparts in Brazil to address these unlawful actions.

*****
Dear ANATEL President Baigorri,
¬†
The FCC and ANATEL, the lead communications regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Brazil, have had a long-standing relationship‚Äîone built on reciprocity, respect for the rule of law, and our shared status as independent agencies established by law to operate without undue influence from the partisan political branches of our governments. ¬†

The sectors we regulate stand to benefit from continuing a partnership based on adherence to those foundational principles. ¬†Indeed, you recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the FCC‚Äôs Chairwoman that further formalized the FCC and ANATEL relationship.
¬†
Nonetheless, I am compelled to address with you today the cascading set of apparently unlawful and partisan political actions that your agency has been carrying out against businesses with U.S. ties, including your own threat to pull Starlink‚Äôs licenses and authorizations to operate in Brazil. ¬†

These punitive actions‚Äîbacked publicly by the Lula Administration‚Äîare already reverberating broadly and shaking confidence in the stability and predictability of Brazil‚Äôs regulated markets. ¬†In fact, U.S. business leaders are now openly questioning whether Brazil is on the path to becoming an uninvestable market.
¬†
ANATEL is now actively enforcing a widely criticized decision by Justice de Moraes to censor X that, according to government officials in Brazil, violates Brazil‚Äôs own Constitution and your country‚Äôs statutory prohibitions against government censorship. ¬†

To make matters worse, Justice de Moraes chose to enforce his decision by freezing the assets of Starlink‚Äîeven though Starlink is a separate company with different shareholders that has broken no laws.

Justice de Moraes has failed to respect universal and basic tenets of transparency, fair notice, and due process. ¬†

Indeed, it has now been revealed that Justice de Moraes has been sending social media companies secret orders to censor the political posts of elected members of Brazil‚Äôs Congress. ¬†

‚ÄúIf this sounds authoritarian, it is,‚Äù the Washington Post wrote this week about Justice de Moraes‚Äôs takedown campaign. ¬†Continuing, the Washington Post stated that Brazil‚Äôs recent moves come ‚Äúat a substantial cost to free expression‚Äîwith mandates for removals and even arrest warrants often issued under seal and with scant reasoning to support them.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBrazilians shouldn‚Äôt have to put up with government suppressing political viewpoints,‚Äù it concluded.
¬†
While Justice de Moraes‚Äôs actions mirror crackdowns on free speech that are taking place across the globe, I am not writing you today based on a generalized concern about free expression‚Äîthough I believe strongly that communications regulators like us should stand against this trend towards censorship. ¬†Nor am I arguing that these actions by Brazil‚Äôs government somehow violate U.S. laws on free speech ‚Ä¶
¬†
But according to Brazilian officials and legal authorities, Brazil is now violating its own laws through arbitrary and capricious actions against X and Starlink. ¬†Indeed, the Justice de Moraes decision runs headlong into Brazil‚Äôs own Constitution, which expressly prohibits ‚Äú[a]ny and all censorship of a political, ideological and artistic nature,‚Äù as well as other provisions of Brazilian law that further guarantee freedom of expression.
¬†
The serious and apparently unlawful actions against X and Starlink cannot be squared with the principles of reciprocity, rule of law, and independence that have served as the foundation of the FCC and ANATEL relationship and the basis for reciprocal foreign investment.
¬†
I am therefore requesting a meeting with you to address and resolve these issues. ¬†If you prefer, I will come to you in Brazil to do so.",2024-09-05 19:34:14+00:00

These citizens‚Äô accounts had only a small number of followers and their posts merely expressed support for conservative viewpoints and politicians.

Moraes failed to identify a single illegal post by any of these individuals, let alone any justification for blocking their entire accounts. Most likely, they were censored because Moraes opposed their political beliefs.

"As another example of Judge de Moraes‚Äô illegal conduct, he issued the following order in January 2023 completely blocking all social media accounts of several prominent Brazilians, including:

- The podcaster Monark (known as the ‚ÄúBrazilian Joe Rogan‚Äù)
- Brazilian Senator Alan Rick
- Brazilian Congressman Nikolas Ferreira, who had received the most votes of any Congressman in history

The order is unconstitutional in five different ways:

(1) The order violates the constitutional right of freedom of speech, which is guaranteed by article 5¬∞, IV, of the Brazilian Federal  Constitution.

Importantly, Moraes disregarded earlier Supreme Court decisions that had already ruled that freedom of speech protects the right to share opinions and to access different perspectives and points of view.

(2) The order was issued in secret, which violates article 5, LX of the Brazilian Federal Constitution, which states that judicial decisions must be public, other than in exceptional cases when the public interest requires it. The order provides no reason to justify the secrecy and merely serves to avoid public scrutiny.

(3) The order contains no reasons, which violates article 5, LV, of the Brazilian Federal Constitution, which guarantees individuals due process of law and the right to appeal against court decisions.  Without reasons, X does not know why the accounts are being censored and on what grounds to appeal.

(4) The order blocks the accounts of sitting federal legislators Alan Rick and Nikolas Ferreira. This violates Article 53 of the Federal Constitution, which explicitly states that legislators‚Äô opinions, words, and votes are inviolable.

(5) The order violates the right to informational self-determination ‚Äì the right of individuals to control and protect their own personal data ‚Äì which is guaranteed by article 5, LXXIX, of the Brazilian Federal Constitution.

"A big problem for Democrats in 2024 is that they‚Äôve painted Trump as literal evil incarnate.

In response, Trump is going on a ton of long-form podcasts where a lot of independents are watching and listening to Trump speak - many of them for the first time - and are able to form an opinion based on what they see first hand.

This is a stark contrast to how a lot of us have absorbed information in the past, which is whatever Legacy Media has shoved down our throats. It is not secret that Legacy Media, by and large, has a left-leaning bias.

This will - without a doubt - win voters that are unhappy with the system (which is A LOT of people - 19% of the country think Congress is doing a good job, 50% of the country identifies as Independent).

Trump‚Äôs entire position since the beginning is being the hammer to whatever we‚Äôve built thus far, which has been very ineffective for many to put it mildly. His ability to be an effective hammer is still an open question.

However, by default, if Kamala doesn‚Äôt start doing long-form interviews or podcasts where Independents are able to gauge, first hand, her policy and who she is as a person, she will lose, and likely lose by a lot.

Anecdotally - I have many folks within my circle that I consider to be independent voters. As a whole, my circle leans left. None of them are enthusiastic about Kamala, and all of them have been softer on Trump vs 2020.

This is obviously in stark contrast to many polls, so my very small sample could be totally wrong.

But just like 2016, I think polls are missing a very significant shift in the general public. I think this shift is being driven by many choosing to forgo Legacy Media as their primary source of information, and instead absorbing information from more independent voices.

A lot of these voices, at least from what I‚Äôve noticed, are questioning the system much more often, much more loudly, and much more confidently.

I think how COVID was handled, paired with Government‚Äôs heavy-handed approach to silence speech that was challenging the ‚Äòtrue‚Äô narrative - which by the way is now proven to be unquestionable true (Twitter Files, Zuck‚Äôs letter)‚Ä¶ which is a literal obstruction of the First Amendment - have many convinced that whatever we‚Äôve got going on now ain‚Äôt working.

In short - the whole ‚ÄòTrump is an evil dictator‚Äô and ‚ÄòKamala is an evil communist‚Äô rhetoric is shallow and does nothing.

Instead, in depth discussions that reveals the individuals character, paired with policy, will win the day.

Only podcasts can do this, and only one candidate has taken this on.

"IN THE GLOBAL STRUGGLE AGAINST AUTHORITARIANISM, THE WEST‚ÄôS REAL ENEMY IS ITSELF

American politicians speak constantly about the indispensable role of the United States in leading the free world against authoritarianism. If that is true, why is the White House so silent in the face of new global threats to free speech? 

In January, American citizen Gonzalo Lira died in a Ukrainian prison for posting YouTube videos; the State Department didn‚Äôt lift a finger to help. Last week, Telegram founder Pavel Durov was arrested in France for the crime of insufficient content moderation. 

Now Brazil has banned X for resisting the diktats of a tyrannical judge, who salivates over the possibility of jailing @elonmusk. The EU is one step behind, with Eurocrat Thierry Breton pursuing a criminal investigation against Elon for ‚Äúplatforming disinformation,‚Äù which Breton defines to include a conversation with Donald Trump. 

In the UK, the government of Keir Starmer imprisons critics of open borders with more zeal than it prosecutes violent crime. In Canada, Justin Trudeau crushed a trucker protest against vaccine mandates by asserting sweeping new powers to freeze bank accounts.  

At no point has the White House expressed concern about this new iron curtain that seems to be descending across the West. Quite the contrary, Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that the Biden-Harris administration repeatedly pressured Meta to censor during Covid. Worse, the FBI primed Facebook to censor true stories about Biden Family corruption by suggesting that Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop was Russian disinformation (even though the FBI knew it was authentic). 

Barring court intervention, TikTok will shut down in the U.S. on January 19, 2025 thanks to a new power authorized by Congress to ban websites and applications that the President determines are subject to the influence of a foreign adversary. X may not be far behind if liberal elites and deep state apparatchiks like Robert Reich and  Alexander Vindman get their wish. They have called for the U.S. to adopt Brazil‚Äôs and the EU‚Äôs approach and ‚Äúrein in‚Äù Elon Musk. 

Hypocritically, the same voices demanding this crackdown are also the loudest in proclaiming the West to be engaged in a ‚Äúwar on authoritarianism‚Äù against countries like Russia and China. But whatever their other sins, Russia and China are in no position to deprive American citizens of their free speech rights; only our own government can do that. 

Similarly, if Western leaders truly wanted to prevent authoritarianism, the easiest place to start would be at home, protecting the civil liberties of their own citizens. Instead they seem obsessed with deflecting the public‚Äôs attention onto foreign enemies, as Orwell depicted in the Two Minutes Hate in 1984.  

As this battle over free speech heats up in an election year, where do the candidates stand? Donald Trump has declared his support for free speech whereas Kamala Harris has said nothing and can be expected to continue her administration‚Äôs policy of tacit approval of creeping censorship. In just two months, Americans will decide. Do we actually lead the free world in standing up for free speech, or do we accept the authoritarianism we claim to detest so much?",2024-09-02 03:47:43+00:00

Arthur Lira:

‚ÄúThe legal fight around X should never have escalated to blocking Starlink bank accounts.‚Äù

Note: We are running this video exclusively for Metropoles, an exceptional Brazilian news outlet, due to Moraes' ban and threat of fines.

Source: @Metropoles",2024-08-31 20:22:05+00:00
"The world took a giant leap forward into totalitarianism yesterday as the Brazilian government blocked X, formerly Twitter, and threatened to fine its citizens $8,900 per day if they use it. 

Brazil, the world's sixth largest nation by population, now joins North Korea, China, and Iran in the list of countries that have banned X. It is the 12th largest economy in the world and the superpower of the global South. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter whether or not you care about Brazil. Its totalitarianism is at risk of spreading around the world.

Yet neither President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, nor anyone else in the US government has formally denounced the censorship. That‚Äôs probably because Biden, Harris, and Democrats not only support the censorship but have also been directly funding it.

Of course, there is authentic demand for censorship from within Brazil, and it is ultimately up to the Brazilian people to reverse the nation‚Äôs descent into totalitarianism. Brazil‚Äôs powerful government-funded news media corporations have been urging censorship, which benefits President Lula‚Äôs ruling Workers‚Äô Party. It‚Äôs up to Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco to impeach the Supreme Court Justice turned dictator, Alexandre de Moraes.

At the same time, the Biden administration and Democrats have played an influential role in instigating censorship in Brazil. The FBI went to Brazil and gave its Supreme Court justices advice on how to censor its population. The US government has been funding many of the NGOs in Brazil that have demanded censorship since the election of a populist president there in 2018. And when I testified before Congress in May of this year, the Democrats on the committee and their witness defended Brazil‚Äôs censorship.

And Pacheco yesterday affirmed his support for Moraes.

After the election of populist president Jair Bolsonaro in 2018, the US government funded pro-censorship organizations that demanded censorship. Moraes yesterday openly defended censorship to prevent ‚Äúextremist populist groups‚Äù from coming to power. As United States Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr noted yesterday, that‚Äôs a direct violation of the Brazilian constitution, which explicitly protects political speech.

As such, the totalitarian takeover of Brazil is a model for what the Democrats and the legacy news media want for the whole world. Pro-censorship scholars at Stanford and Harvard, Democrats in Congress, and the US news media have long recognized that the First Amendment is an obstacle to their plans. And so they have supported censorship efforts by nations with weaker free speech protections, like Brazil, Britain, Australia, and the European Union, to censor and even block X.

It‚Äôs important that we fight back. We need to show our support for free speech. I urge my Brazilian friends to stay on the platform. Everyone knows that it would be extremely difficult for Moraes to enforce his insane decree, much less fairly and equally. Proof of this comes from the fact that the Brazilian government and the ruling Workers‚Äô Party are still using X, which means they are also using VPNs to evade their own ban.

Brazil is thus not just a dictatorship but a lawless one. Its leaders are behaving like the hypocritical pig leaders in George Orwell‚Äôs Animal Farm.

And independent Brazilian politicians including Senator Eduardo Gir√£o, Congressman Marcel Van Hattam, and Vice Governor of Minas Gerais, Mateus Sim√µes are all resisting the ban and posting on X. ‚ÄúI never imagined myself practicing and propagating civil disobedience,‚Äù said Sim√µes, ‚Äúbut censorship cannot be tolerated, ever.‚Äù

If you‚Äôre not already a premium subscriber to X, please consider becoming one. If you can do more, please consider subscribing to Public. And if you can do even more than that, please make a tax-deductible donation to the free speech movement here:

https://t.co/iaiEtv1t3H

Biden and Harris and other political leaders must denounce what is happening. It‚Äôs incredible that the only US government official to criticize Brazil‚Äôs dictators is the FCC‚Äôs Brendan Carr. Congress must hold hearings. People around the world should recognize Brazil‚Äôs banning of X as an attack on free speech everywhere. Everyone is at greater risk of totalitarianism when major countries like Brazil succumb to it.

The good news is that the whole world is watching and many in the legacy news media in Brazil are denouncing the government‚Äôs ban on X. It‚Äôs not too late to turn things around. The world took a giant leap toward dystopia yesterday. But a worldwide free speech movement can pull Brazil back. It‚Äôs time to make 1984 and Animal Farm fiction again.",2024-08-31 20:16:55+00:00

"Glenn Greenwald says corporate journalists are losing their minds over @elonmusk calling out major corporations for stifling free speech because they are in bed with the very corporations they claim to scrutinize.

@ggreenwald explains that we are at a crossroads where journalism, once a watchdog of establishment power, is now shackled by corporate advertisers.

""What went wrong here is not what Elon Musk said. It's so revealing that so many journalists are aghast that anyone would dare tell Disney and major corporations to go f**k yourself when they're trying to limit, censor, and control the flow of political content.

If you aren't willing to say that to corporations who are trying to limit what you can say, don't bother calling yourself a journalist.

We need way more journalists willing to say, go f**k yourself to people who try and limit what they say. 

The problem is, is that the people who are hired by these major media corporations, and who thrive in them and succeed in them are people who have the opposite instinct.

Their instinct is to assuage and serve and placate establishment power, not to defy it. Even though the purpose of journalism is to be adversarial to establishment power.

Once journalism started getting corporatized no longer owned by families dedicated to journalism or local communities but by major corporations that have all kinds of other interests besides their media division. And, what kind of attributes are awarded at major corporations? 

People who avoid controversy who avoid conflict, who avoid displeasing and angering powerful people. That's the corporate ethos, and the corporatization of media meant that that kind of attribute was imported into journalism. 

And that's why almost no one who works for large media corporations or the media corporations themselves has the courage to say this. They're shocked. They think it's a sign that he's unhinged when in reality, it's just a sign of how cowardly and craven they are.""",2023-11-30 05:44:18+00:00

"Last year, the FCC upheld its 2022 decision to deny SpaceX's @Starlink an $885 million subsidy to bring broadband to 642,000 Americans living in rural areas. FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel didn't think Starlink could deliver the promised service.

Today, Starlink is connecting over 7,700 new customers per day, FEMA is sending Starlink terminals to help victims in North Carolina due to Hurricane Helene, and the world's largest airlines are signing contracts to outfit their entire fleets with it. It has proven to be a reliable and fast service for millions of users.

The FCC had program requirements that Starlink didn't have to meet until 2025, yet the FCC Chair was unfairly making a prediction about whether Starlink would meet them or not years before the deadline. Starlink needed to show that it was more likely than not that it could provide high-speed Internet service (low-latency, 100/20 Mbps service) to at least 40% of the 642,000 rural premises by Dec 31, 2025. Starlink did that.

So why revoke that $885M award? It doesn't make any sense.

FCC Chair Rosenworcel suggested Starlink is not a trustworthy technology. If that were true, why are other parts of the U.S. government entering into large contracts with @SpaceX for Starlink service?

The FCC should reverse its decision, because if the government tries to connect these 642,000 people using fiber, it will cost 10 times more and take years longer. SpaceX's Starlink terminal production is ramping up so fast that they will be the largest printed circuit board manufacturer in the Americas within a few months. The biggest loser in all of this are those 642k people that could have fast internet much sooner.

"X Has Already Won

Elon Musk closed the acquisition of Twitter, now X, in October of 2022. Once that deal was closed, a bunch of advertisers left the platform out of fear of their brands being impacted by the new ‚ÄúFreedom of Speech‚Äù rules that X was looking to implement.

The premise was that ads would be shown next to content that advertisers don‚Äôt want to be associated with, and because X would now allow more ‚Äúimproper‚Äù content, the chances of having a negative ad experience could increase.

After leaving the platform for a few weeks, almost all advertisers have come back, albeit with lower ad spends. However, earlier this year, X gave guidance that the platform is near cash-flow neutral, minus debt obligations. This means that even though the platform has suffered losses in terms of ad revenue, the company is close to being self-sufficient.

In other words, no outside cash has to be brought into the company to keep it alive, as long as the trend continues.

Fast forward a few months, and after controversial comments made by Elon and an effort by Media Matters to encourage advertisers to boycott the platform, advertisers left again.

However - just like the first time, after a few weeks, advertisers are beginning to come back. There‚Äôs confirmation that Netflix has started to spend ad money on the platform again, and per Elon at his recent conference in Italy, advertisers are beginning to come back to the platform en masse.

I think all of this points to something quite clear - the Overton Window is beginning to shift, and with it, a massively profitable endeavor for advertisers.

For those that are not familiar, the Overton Window is a term used to express what is ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù to be discussed in a given time period. If you compare what is acceptable to be discussed on X today, vs what was acceptable on Twitter pre-acquisition, you can very clearly see that the ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù topics are much more diverse and plentiful. This means that the Overton Window has shifted.

Another example of this is also on YouTube. A few days ago, Mario hosted a space with Elon Musk, Alex Jones, Andrew Tate, and other folks discussing Alex‚Äôs reinstatement and a bunch of other topics. These topics pre-acquisition would not be admissible under Twitter‚Äôs former rules. What‚Äôs really interesting is that after making this edited content available on YouTube, YouTube has a) not taken down the content from the platform and b) allowed monetization on the content.

This implies that advertisers are now becoming comfortable advertising on content that they weren‚Äôt comfortable with in the past.

What does this mean for X? It‚Äôs quite simple - X‚Äôs willingness to stand for Free Speech, even when the CEO makes statements that cause the business to temporarily lose revenue, is creating a brand new market for advertisers that previously did not exist precisely due to an unwillingness to embrace Freedom of Speech.

And because X‚Äôs entire approach has been to uphold Freedom of Speech and accept the repercussions that come with it, the platform has positioned itself as the premier place for content that will be generated on this principle.

This same content is a market that advertisers have had 0 access to in the past because of the unwillingness of platforms to embrace Freedom of Speech, and the skittishness of ad agencies to sully their brands with controversial topics. On top of this, it‚Äôs a market that is untapped, which will generate billions of views, and billions of dollars, for creators and advertisers alike.

I do not suspect we‚Äôll see another advertisers boycott in the future because of this dynamic. There‚Äôs way too much money to be made, and now that the Overton Window has shifted to where the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù is now ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù with listening to dissenting and controversial opinions, advertisers will be tripping over themselves to advertise on X over the long term.

In my opinion, people respect the notion of being allowed to think for themselves, and because this has been subdued for far too long, there will be an avalanche of interest for content that is specifically challenging and controversial. Ultimately, this will be massively profitable for advertisers due to the engagement and attention it‚Äôll receive from the public.

I posited when Elon bought the platform that X would win if they could make Freedom of Speech profitable, and I think we‚Äôre starting to see glimpses of this being the case.",2023-12-16 17:54:00+00:00

"üö®üö®üö® Exclusive to @RepStefanik, @EliseStefanik, @elonmusk, @BillAckman, @realchrisrufo, @realChrisBrunet, @MZHemingway, @mtaibbi.

I have received from inside Harvard sources a smoking gun August 20, 2020 memo from Claudine Gay (now Harvard President) to the Faculty of Arts & Sciences when she was Dean. It flies in the face of everything she said to @RepStefanik & the world last week. 

This memo was written when she was a short-listed candidate for the Harvard presidency. We must face a stunning possibility: Gay got the the job precisely because she holds these views.

This memo not only exposes her hypocrisy & duplicity but also the real source of what makes her (and those like her) the most destructive force in American higher education. This memo is a blueprint for the intellectual corruption & politicization of a once great institution, and it laid the groundwork for the anti-semitism & the anti-Americanism rampant at Harvard today.

This is Gay's agenda for Harvard, which means for the rest of American higher education. Gay obviously should be fired, but that's not enough. Her ideological agenda must be opposed and tossed in the dustbin of history.

Please read & REPOST. 

Dear members of the FAS community,
 
As we look ahead to the start of a fall semester unlike any other, we confront the realization that we are now living history in the making. This moment has been shaped by crises old and new, as one pandemic has collided with another. The COVID-19 pandemic is a truly singular event; a public health threat that has spared no part of our academic enterprise from disruption, forcing us to reimagine everything from undergraduate residential life to the daily activities of our labs and libraries. Meanwhile, a second pandemic is unfolding, one with deeper roots in American life. People across the world have risen up in protest against police brutality and systemic racism, awake to the devastating legacies of slavery and white supremacy like never before. The calls for racial justice heard on our streets also echo on our campus, as we reckon with our individual and institutional shortcomings and with our Faculty‚Äôs shared responsibility to bring truth to bear on the pernicious effects of structural inequality. Even as our opportunities to be together on campus are limited, now is the time to reengage and reconnect, both with each other and with the promise of our mission to advance knowledge and discovery in service of a more just world.
 
This moment offers a profound opportunity for institutional change that should not and cannot be squandered. The national conversation around racial equity continues to gain momentum and the unprecedented scale of mobilization and demand for justice gives me hope. In raw, candid conversations and virtual gatherings convened across the FAS in the aftermath of George Floyd‚Äôs brutal murder, members of our community spoke forcefully and with searing clarity about the institution we aspire to be and the lengths we still must travel to be the Harvard of our ideals. It is up to us to ensure that the pain expressed, problems identified, and solutions suggested set us on a path for long-term change. I write today to share my personal commitment to this transformational project and the first steps the FAS will take to advance this important agenda in the coming year.
 
Amplify teaching and research on racial and ethnic inequality
 
The project of building a truly inclusive scholarly community begins with what we consider worthy of research and teaching. A full account of contemporary American society demands scholarship that affirms the relevance, significance, and worth of diverse cultural backgrounds and histories. Moreover, preparing our students for leadership in today‚Äôs globalized yet profoundly unequal society, requires an education that includes the voices, stories, and lived experiences of those too long pushed to the margins. With these goals in mind, I plan a series of investments across our academic enterprise.
 
This fall, we will reactivate the cluster hire¬†in ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration, with the goal of making four new faculty appointments. These appointments are critical to our long-term efforts to strengthen our research and teaching capacity, and ensure that our students have access to this vital body of knowledge. In order to accelerate our progress, however, I am also establishing the Harvard College Visiting Professorship in Ethnicity, Indigeneity, and Migration¬†to recruit leading scholars of race and ethnicity to spend a year at Harvard College actively engaged in teaching our undergraduates. Beginning in 2021-2022, the FAS will appoint up to two new visiting scholars each year, based on recommendations from academic departments. Finally, to seed new research directions and develop the next generation of scholars, we will also invest in the academic pipeline. The Inequality in America postdoctoral fellowship program, which currently recruits two new fellows each year, will be expanded in the coming year to recruit two additional early career scholars whose work focuses specifically on issues of racial and ethnic inequality.
 
Foster a more inclusive visual culture

The FAS has a long and proud history of discovery and achievement that is worthy of celebration. But it also has painful chapters of its history, marred by exclusion and discrimination. To become the inclusive scholarly community we aspire to be, we must confront our dual legacies with honesty, humility, and resolve, including how they are visually represented in the spaces where we work, live, and learn. Our visual culture should reflect our deep, abiding commitments to advance knowledge and critical thinking, honoring our past in a truthful way, while also celebrating the diversity and vitality of our present and instilling a sense of pride and belonging that is equally available to all members of our community. Honest and rigorous conversation about how we weave together our past, present, and future is necessary to build the stronger, more equitable FAS we envision.

This fall, I am launching the Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage¬†to take up this consequential conversation. Led by Dean of Arts and Humanities, Robin Kelsey, this task force will convene a group of faculty, staff, and students from across the FAS to conduct a comprehensive study of our visual culture and articulate principles and informed guidelines for evolving the visual culture and imagery of the FAS. It is my hope that this work will provide a stronger foundation for the creative and meaningful action already happening at the local level, as well as catalyze new, more systematic visual change across the whole of the FAS.
 
Build our capacity to pursue inclusive excellence
 
Aligning our values with institutional action will bring us closer to the Harvard we aspire to be. But to make meaningful strides, our efforts cannot be ad hoc or lack accountability to a comprehensive strategy with concrete and measurable goals. What is required is focused, intentional action at every level of the FAS to dismantle the cultural and structural barriers that have precluded progress. And we must put real resources behind this work. Good intentions alone will not suffice.
 
As a first step towards building our capacity for inclusive excellence, I soon will appoint the inaugural Associate Dean of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging¬†for the FAS. Their work will be dedicated to the creation and implementation of an FAS-wide strategic vision for inclusive excellence that enables all members of our community to be seen, heard, and to flourish. They will report directly to me, and will work closely with the FAS senior leadership team to develop concrete goals and identify personal, departmental, divisional, and school-level actions for building an effective and active culture of anti-racism in the FAS.
 
Expand leadership opportunities for staff of color
 
Staff leaders of color remain significantly underrepresented in the FAS, and we are missing out on this talent to our own detriment. The benefits of diverse teams for organizational performance are well-documented, from spurring innovation and creative problem solving to challenging the assumptions and conventional wisdom that limit our thinking. Understanding the needs of our increasingly diverse student body demands fresh ideas and perspectives so that we make the best possible decisions for our community. If inclusive excellence is our goal, addressing the racial disparities in our administrative leadership must be part of the plan. ¬†
 
I will launch a study of the hiring, professional development, and promotion practices that may contribute to the low representation of minority staff in managerial and executive roles carrying significant decision-making responsibility and authority. Led by the incoming Associate Dean of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, and working closely with Leslie Kirwan, Dean for Administration and Finance, Nina Zipser, Dean for Faculty Affairs, and Rakesh Khurana, Danoff Dean of Harvard College, the study will identify concrete steps we can take to increase racial diversity of senior staff¬†and recommend near- and long-term hiring goals for the FAS.
--
These initiatives are just a starting place. Our engagement in anti-racist action and the infusion of inclusive practices into all aspects of our teaching and research mission reflect a new sense of institutional responsibility and will require sustained effort over time. Just like the learning that takes place in our classrooms and labs, this work demands thoughtful attention, experimentation (not all of which will be successful), and patience and humility for when we get it wrong. No one person or institution (not even Harvard!) has all the answers, and we cannot achieve our goals without the courage to listen deeply and generously and to act with urgency, seriousness of purpose, and a mind towards continual growth. The work of racial justice is not a one-time project. We must be relentless, constructively critical, and action-oriented in our pursuit to build the thriving, more equitable FAS we all deserve.
 
Even as I say that, I am clear-eyed that the work of real change will be difficult and for many it will be uncomfortable. Change is messy work. Institutional inertia will threaten to overwhelm even our best efforts. If we are to succeed, we must challenge a status quo that is comfortable and convenient for many. But I believe progress can be made and will be beneficial to all members of our community.
 
Collectively, we are the authors of Harvard‚Äôs future. As we begin this historic year, I offer you my personal commitment to be a partner and ally in the work for equity and justice. And I urge you all to lean into the profound optimism that animates our mission and join your colleagues in building what will ultimately be a proud chapter in the long story of Harvard.¬†
 
Sincerely,
Claudine

"The presidents of @Harvard, @MIT, and @Penn were all asked the following question under oath at today‚Äôs congressional hearing on antisemitism:

Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate [your university‚Äôs] code of conduct or rules regarding bullying or harassment?

The answers they gave reflect the profound moral bankruptcy of Presidents Gay, Magill and Kornbluth. 

Representative @EliseStefanik was so shocked with the answers that she asked each of them the same question over and over again, and they gave the same answers over and over again. 

In short, they said:

It ‚Äòdepends on the context‚Äô and ‚Äòwhether the speech turns into conduct,‚Äô that is, actually killing Jews. 

This could be the most extraordinary testimony ever elicited in the Congress, certainly on the topic of genocide, which to remind us all is:

‚Äúthe deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group‚Äù

The presidents‚Äô answers reflect the profound educational, moral and ethical failures that pervade certain of our elite educational institutions due in large part to their failed leadership. 

Don‚Äôt take my word for it. 

You must watch the following three minutes. By the end, you will be where I am.

If a CEO of one of our companies gave a similar answer, he or she would be toast within the hour. 

Why has antisemitism exploded on campus and around the world? 

Because of leaders like Presidents Gay, Magill and Kornbluth who believe genocide depends on the context. 

To think that these are the leaders of Ivy League institutions that are charged with the responsibility to educate our best and brightest. 

On the bright side, our congressional leaders deserve accolades for showing tremendous leadership and moral clarity in their statements, by the questions they asked, and the respectfulness with which they conducted the hearing. 

It was a masterclass of how our government and democracy should operate. 

If you have time, please watch the entire hearing. Throughout the hearing, the three behaved like hostile witnesses, exhibiting a profound disdain for the Congress with their smiles and smirks, and their outright refusal to answer basic questions with a yes or no answer.",2023-12-05 23:25:30+00:00

Greg Gutfeld stands up for Elon Musk and says the quiet part out loud: Tucker Carlson was canceled from Fox by special interest groups tied to political interests.   https://t.co/T9yYOTzLEM,2023-12-02 06:11:56+00:00
"The All-In Pod asks @TuckerCarlson why he was fired by FOX News and what role corporate advertisers play in shaping news coverage?

Tucker highlights Big Pharma, constituting 75% of TV ads in 2020, then delves into COVID, lockdowns, mRNA shots, January 6th, and the War in Ukraine.

""It not only exists, it defines news coverage. Especially on pharma because pharma is the biggest advertiser on television. If Pfizer is sponsoring your show, you are not going to question the vax... And that's why they are the biggest advertiser. So they can shape news coverage.""

Tucker explains that he was not surprised by his firing because it is implicitly understood within the industry that sharing opinions that conflict with corporate advertisers eventually gets you fired.

""I had a lot of opinions that were unpopular with people who might have influenced my show getting canceled... But I was not shocked at all. You can't give the finger to everybody and persist in a corporate job.""

This aligns with Glenn Greenwald's (@ggreenwald) recent analysis, shared by @elonmusk, illustrating how modern journalism, once a check on established power, is now controlled by corporate advertisers.

(https://t.co/4N6HWeDs4j)

The ongoing corporate boycott of @X, ostensibly based on a false antisemitism claim, reflects this broader pattern.

Empirical data reveals platforms like TikTok and Instagram promote significantly more antisemitism than @X, yet corporate advertisers are only targeting this platform.

(https://t.co/HBZPjGuuMb)

This contradiction underscores the corporate @X boycott is less about combating antisemitism and more about stifling freedom of speech online.

When @elonmusk defiantly tells this union of major corporate advertisers and establishment power to ""go f**k yourself"" for attempting to bankrupt his company, he's pointing at the authoritarian illiberal forces attempting to control online speech through advertising dollars.

Elon Musk, Glenn Greenwald, and Tucker Carlson rightly point the finger at this dangerous alliance of corporate and government power, manipulating news and shaping social media platforms through advertising dollars.

These authoritarian illiberal forces starkly oppose the core principles of freedom, liberty, and enlightenment that have fostered the modern prosperity of so many people in the Western world.

"I thought @elonmusk‚Äôs interview with @andrewrsorkin was one of the great interviews ever. Musk is a free speech absolutist which I respect. I think he is entirely correct that he and @X are treated unfairly and inconsistently by advertisers. 

@tiktok_us @instagram @facebook and others have enormous amounts of problematic content, antisemitic and otherwise, but the advertisers don‚Äôt boycott those platforms. 

Musk is targeted because the other media organizations view @X as a competitor and any time his name is in an article about controversies, it draws clicks. MSM is incentivized to attack him as it actually drives attention to their sites and therefore more revenues. It is these attack articles by other media organizations that put pressure on the @Disney‚Äôs of the world to stop advertising on X. 

If Bob Iger would carefully examine the facts, he would likely continue to advertise on X, but Disney caves to public pressure rather than do the right thing. Meanwhile Disney invests heavily on TikTok, likely alongside videos of kids teaching other teenagers to be anorexic and worse.  I am sure Nelson Peltz can fix this when he joins the Disney board. 

X presents the opportunity for advertisers to access an incredible global audience that is not available elsewhere. And it is cheap compared to other alternatives because of current circumstances.  

On Musk and antisemitism:

After examining the facts, it was clear to me that Musk did not have antisemitic intent when he responded with the ‚Äòactual truth‚Äô tweet, and further clarified thereafter. 

I thought he made what he meant extremely clear in the @andrewrsorkin interview, namely, that Jews are drawn to support ‚Äòoppressed‚Äô groups and causes through various non-profits due to our history of being an oppressed minority. 

Musk points out correctly that a number of these organizations and their members support Hamas. And he is correct in saying that Jews should rethink support for organizations that seek their elimination. 

Many Jews are doing that right now. 

To use a Muskism, Earth is fortunate that @X is owned by an individual that is largely insulated from financial and other influence.  That said, perhaps some form of very carefully governed trust would be a better forever owner than any individual. 

@PershingSqFdn invested in the Twitter privatization in support of free speech. Whether we make a profit on our investment is not important to us as we never intend to sell our interest. 

I am more inclined to like and support companies that advertise on the platform because I appreciate their support for free speech. I have actually bought products I learned about from ads on @X. I can‚Äôt think of another example of my responding to direct advertising other than on X. 

Unfortunately, recent (and society‚Äôs long-term experience) with non-profit governance, see @OpenAI, certain private universities etc. should not give anyone confidence that a traditional non-profit would be a better owner of X than Musk. 

Perhaps some day the ownership of X should be distributed to each American, one share for each American during their lives and one for each person born, with a charter which permanently vests the free speech principles by which it operates. 

Until then, we all should be grateful that X is owned by Musk.",2023-12-01 04:23:27+00:00

"üö®THREAD: Tucker Carlson on Duplicated Ballots, Falsified Tally Sheets, and Mail-In Ballot Fraud in Fulton County, Georgia

‚ÄúIt now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia, last November (2020). That is not a conspiracy theory. It‚Äôs true.

Surveillance footage obtained by VoterGA shows large numbers of ballots being scanned multiple times. Pay attention to the women wearing yellow at the desk. According to VoterGA, she slides ballots into a scanning machine, removes the ballots, and then reinserts the same ballots. 

This happens multiple times. The question is, how many times were these ballots counted? Was each vote counted more than once? Fulton County won't answer that question. 

Now, one way to know that answer would be to check what are called audit tally sheets. Tellingly, for months after the 2020 election, Fulton County failed to provide more than 100,000 of those tally sheets, including 50,000 of them from mail-in ballots. 

When VoterGA finally forced Fulton County to turn over the tally sheets, the conclusion was stunning. Here's what the audit found. Seven falsified audit tally sheets containing fabricated vote totals... For example, a batch containing 59 actual ballot images for Joe Biden and 42 for Donald Trump was reported as 100 for Biden and 0 for Trump. 

The seven batches of ballot images with 554 votes for Joe Biden, 140 votes for Donald Trump, and 11 votes for Jo Jorgenson had tally sheets in the audit falsified to show 850 votes for Biden, 0 votes for Trump, and 0 votes for Jorgenson. 

Wait, did you just follow that? 

How is that not flat-out criminal fraud?""",2023-11-10 19:17:55+00:00

The xAI PromptIDE is an integrated development environment for prompt engineering and interpretability research.
It accelerates prompt engineering through an SDK that allows implementing complex prompting techniques and rich analytics that
visualize the network's outputs.

We originally created PromptIDE to accelerate our development of Grok. It has helped us iterate quickly over different prompts and prompting techniques.
We are now making the IDE available to members of our Grok early access program.

"This has been a year full of engineering excellence that sometimes can go unnoticed. Besides all the visible changes you see on our app, here are some of the most important improvements we have made under the hood.

- Consolidated the tech stacks for For you, Following, Search, Profiles, Lists, Communities and Explore around a singular product framework.

- Completely rebuilt the For you serving and ranking systems from the ground up, resulting in a decrease 90% reduction in lines of code from 700K to 70K, a 50% decrease in our compute footprint, and an 80% increase in the throughput of posts scored per request.

- Unified the For you and video personalization and ranking models, which significantly improved video recommendation quality.

- Refactored the API middleware layer of our tech stack and in doing so simplified the architecture by  removing more than 100K lines of code and thousands of unused internal endpoints and eliminating unadopted client services.

- Reduced post metadata sourcing latency by 50%, and global API timeout errors by 90%.

- Blocked bots and content scrapers at a rate +37% greater than 2022. On average, we prevent more than 1M bots signup attacks each day and we‚Äôve reduced DM spam by 95%.

- Shutdown the Sacramento data center and re-provisioned the 5,200 racks and 148,000 servers, which generated more than $100M in annual savings. In total, we freed up 48 MW of capacity and tore down 60k lbs. of network ladder rack before re-provisioning it to other data centers.

- Optimized our usage of cloud service providers and began doing much more on-prem. This shift has reduced our monthly cloud costs by 60%. Among the changes we made was a shift of all media/blob artifacts out of the cloud, which reduced our overall cloud data storage size by 60%, and separately, we succeeded in reducing cloud data processing costs by 75%.

- Built on-prem GPU Supercompute clusters and designed, developed, and delivered 43.2Tbps of new network fabric architecture to support the clusters.

- Scaled network backbone capacity and redundancy, which resulted in $13.9M/year in savings.

- Started automated peak traffic failover tests to validate the scalability and availability of the entire platform continuously.",2023-10-27 04:05:37+00:00

TLDR: Grok 3 hands down victory

Query: Find me Settlers of Catan Cities and Knights, not 5-6 players and not Legend of Conquerors, price and delivery time, Northern California 

Speed: 
üèÜ Grok 3 - 84 seconds 160 sources - since summarized chain of thought is exposed perception of speed is even better 
üò¢ OpenAI - 20 minutes 33 seconds 25 sources 

Accuracy: 
üèÜ Grok 3 - first sentence of response ‚ÄúBest price is $59.99.. available from Amazon..‚Äù
üò¢ OpenAI - ‚ÄúPriced at $43.97 ..(link to Amazon)‚Äù - Amazon link leads to generic Amazon search page, no actual link to the mentioned product. Same with other retailer links 

Thoroughness: 
üèÜ Grok 3 - 160 sources, but it also searched Ebay and found some local game stores as options in Mountain View even if there was no inventory 
üò¢ OpenAI - 25 sources - never got to Ebay.. 
I think the sources number is not apples to apples as I think Grok is counting per hit and it hits multiple times per chain of thought 

UX 
üèÜ Grok 3 - the chain of thought is more exposed and clearer, and it just has better flow. The summary result is also superior as it starts out with an Exec Sum and then states its thought process in an elegant streamlined way, ending with a nicely formatted table 
üò¢ OpenAI - Decided to rank the options by size of retailer.. which seems like kind of an odd choice. No table in summary

Overall
üèÜ Grok 3 - dude the xAI guys are doing something illegal it‚Äôs so good. Are they illegally scraping or running a browser instance to access these sites or ignoring robots txt or something. Why is it so fast? Why ?

"OpenAI had a significant lead from summer 2022 through spring 2024 when Google and Anthropic caught up to GPT-4. 7ish quarters of dominance as a result of being the first to aggressively bet on the traditional scaling ‚Äúlaw‚Äù for pre-training.

Being first to reasoning with o1 only led to a few months of advantage.

Deepseek, Google and xAI are at rough parity with OpenAI today. xAI arguably in the lead. Google and xAI will likely decisively surpass o3 soon as their base models are better. So urgent need for GPT-5 as the basis for a putative ‚Äúo5‚Äùreasoning model.

Sam noted that OpenAI would have a narrower lead going forward and Satya essentially stated that a unique period where they had a tremendous lead in model capability was ending.

IMO, this is why Satya is opting out of funding $160b of pretraining for OpenAI per @theinformation. Instead he will make money by providing inference to OpenAI.

Google and Xai both have unique, valuable sources of data that will increasingly differentiate them from Deepseek, OpenAI and Anthropic. As does Meta if they catch up from a model capability perspective.

I have paraphrased @ericvishria many times and noted that frontier models without access to unique, valuable data are the fastest depreciating assets in history. Distillation only amplifies this.

It seems like Satya shares this belief; hence opting out of the $160b of pre-training, the rumored datacenter cancellations and his statement on a recent podcast that there is a datacenter overbuild coming and better to lease than buy. Might be a sound decision for Microsoft from an economic perspective and at some point Microsoft might even use an open-source model to power CoPilot.

There may not be any ROI on future frontier models that do not have access to unique, valuable data like YouTube, X, TeslaVision, Instagram and Facebook. Zuckerberg‚Äôs strategy also seems much more sensible from this angle. Unique data might end up being the only basis for differentiation and ROI on pre-training multi-trillion or quadrillion parameter models.

If this is correct, only 2-3 companies will be pre-training frontier models and we will only need a few giant datacenters for the coherent clusters that are needed for pre-training. The rest of AI compute would be smaller datacenters that are geospatially optimized for low latency and/or cost-effective inference. Cost effective inference = cheaper, lower quality power (less premium for Nuclear), less of an imperative for liquid cooling in ST, etc. A very different world from one where 6-10 companies are pre-training frontier models.

Note that reasoning models are extremely compute intensive. Test-time compute means that compute is literally intelligence. So in this scenario there might be even more compute required than in the ‚Äúpre-training‚Äù centric compute scenario that was the base case for the market throughout 2023-2024. But it would be a very different kind of compute as noted above. Instead of a 50/50 split between pre-training and inference it would be 5/95. ¬†Lots of Hondas, very few Ferraris. Infrastructure excellence would be paramount.

And all of this without even considering the implications of on-device inference and/or full quantization - the Deepseek R1 paper was not the most important paper to be published by a Chinese lab in the last year. IYKYK.

"In this thread I'll respond to some of what I've seen out there. Let's start with Niall:

1) On the general background, yes, you have been more right than wrong on a lot of the details of the conflict. Which is why I'm surprised to hear you call the administration's posture ""appeasement."" We are negotiating to end the conflict. It is ""appeasement"" only if you think the Ukrainians have a credible pathway to victory. They don't, so it's not. 

2) As far as I can tell, accusations of ""appeasement"" hinge on a few arguments (not all of them from Niall, to be clear). The first is a criticism that we're even talking to the Russians. Well, the President believes to conduct diplomacy, you actually have to speak to people. This used to be called statesmanship. Second, the idea--based often on fake media reports--that we've ""given the Russians everything they want."" Third, that if we just passed another aid package, Ukraine would roll all the way to Moscow, raise Navalny from the dead, and install a democratic and free leader to Russia (I exaggerate, but only a little). All of these arguments are provably, demonstrably false. 

Many people who have gotten everything wrong about Russia say they know what Russia wants. Many people who know the media reports fake garbage take anonymously sourced reports on a complex negotiation as gospel truth. 

But the bigger issue, as I think Niall knows, is that most of those loudly shouting ""appeasement"" are people who aren't dealing with the reality on the ground. 

3) On the specifics of the negotiation, I""m not confirming details publicly for obvious reasons, but much of what I've seen leaked ranges from entirely bogus to missing critical info. The president has set goals for the negotiation, and I am biased, but I think he's awfully good at this. But we're not going to telegraph our negotiating posture to make people feel better. The president is trying to achieve a lasting piece, not massage the egos or anxieties of people waving Ukraine flags.

The idea that the President of the United States has to start the negotiation by saying ""maybe we'll let Ukraine into NATO"" defies all common sense. Again, it's not appeasement to acknowledge the realities on the ground--realities President Trump has pointed to for years in some cases.

4) Many of the subjective criticisms amount to pearl clutching that don't ultimately matter. I'm happy to defend POTUS's criticisms of the Ukrainian leadership (not that it matters, because he's the president, but I agree with him). You're welcome to disagree. But these critiques of POTUS don't bear on the war or on his negotiation to end it.",2025-02-21 15:20:02+00:00

"This is moralistic garbage, which is unfortunately the rhetorical currency of the globalists because they have nothing else to say. 

For three years, President Trump and I have made two simple arguments: first, the war wouldn't have started if President Trump was in office; second, that neither Europe, nor the Biden administration, nor the Ukrainians had any pathway to victory. This was true three years ago, it was true two years ago, it was true last year, and it is true today. 

And for three years, the concerns of people who were obviously right were ignored. What is Niall's actual plan for Ukraine? Another aid package? Is he aware of the reality on the ground, of the numerical advantage of the Russians, of the depleted stock of the Europeans or their even more depleted industrial base? 

Instead, he quotes from a book about George HW Bush from a different historical period and a different conflict. That's another currency of these people: reliance on irrelevant history.  

President Trump is dealing with reality, which means dealing with facts. And here are some facts:

Number one, while our Western European allies' security has benefitted greatly from the generosity of the United States, they pursue domestic policies (on migration and censorship) that offend the sensibilities of most Americans and defense policies that assume continued over-reliance. 

Number two, Russians have a massive numerical advantage in manpower and weapons in Ukraine, and that advantage will persist regardless of further Western aid packages. Again, the aid is *currently* flowing. 

Number three, the United States retains substantial leverage over both parties to the conflict. 

Number four, ending the conflict requires talking to the people involved in starting it and maintaining it. 

Number five, the conflict has placed--and continues to place--stress on tools of American statecraft, from military stockpiles to sanctions (and so much else). We believe the continued conflict is bad for Russia, bad for Ukraine, and bad for Europe. But most importantly, it is bad for the United States. 

Given the above facts, we must pursue peace, and we must pursue it now. President Trump ran on this, he won on this, and he is right about this. It is lazy, ahistorical nonsense to attack as ""appeasement"" every acknowledgment that America's interest must account for the realities of the conflict. 

That interest--not moralisms or historical illiteracy--will guide President Trump's policy in the weeks to come.

The numbers are staggering: $149 billion in improper government payments last year alone. 

That's enough to fund NASA for seven years or build 15 aircraft carriers.

Medicare and Medicaid lead the pack with over $60 billion in misspent funds, followed by tax credits ($20+ billion) and food assistance ($10+ billion). 

These aren't just accounting errors‚Äîthey represent a fundamental failure of government oversight.

Most revealing is what happens after improper payments are discovered. 

Of $33.5 billion identified as potentially recoverable in 2024, agencies managed to claw back just $22.6 billion. 

The rest evaporates into bureaucratic limbo.

Critics claim DOGE is overreaching by targeting agencies like USAID, but the data shows waste pervades our largest programs. 

While some improper payments are legitimate mistakes, the system's inability to prevent them year after year suggests deeper institutional problems.

The waste continues because it serves the bureaucracy. 

Without DOGE's intervention, next year's report would show the same failures with different numbers.

"A couple reflections on the quantum computing breakthrough we just announced...

Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed.

After a nearly 20 year pursuit, we‚Äôve created an entirely new state of matter, unlocked by a new class of materials, topoconductors, that enable a fundamental leap in computing.

It powers Majorana 1, the first quantum processing unit built on a topological core.

We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.

The qubits created with topoconductors are faster, more reliable, and smaller.

They are 1/100th of a millimeter, meaning we now have a clear path to a million-qubit processor.

Imagine a chip that can fit in the palm of your hand yet is capable of solving problems that even all the computers on Earth today combined could not!

Sometimes researchers have to work on things for decades to make progress possible.

It takes patience and persistence to have big impact in the world.

And I am glad we get the opportunity to do just that at Microsoft.

This is our focus: When productivity rises, economies grow faster, benefiting every sector and every corner of the globe.

It‚Äôs not about hyping tech; it‚Äôs about building technology that truly serves the world.",2025-02-19 16:00:37+00:00

"üö®WHY ELON'S GAMING REVOLUTION MATTERS

Elon's declaration that xAI will launch a game studio represents more than just another side quest‚Äîit's a necessary correction to an industry that's lost its way.

Modern gaming has transformed from an art form focused on player enjoyment into a corporate vehicle for ideological messaging. 

Recent AAA disappointments like Dragon Age: Veilguard and Concord prioritized identity politics over gameplay, alienating core audiences while delivering subpar experiences.

Elon's promise to ""Make Games Great Again"" addresses what millions of gamers have been demanding: a return to fundamentals. 

His approach‚Äîleveraging cutting-edge AI to create adaptive narratives and procedurally generated worlds‚Äîcould deliver revolutionary experiences while sidestepping the bureaucratic bloat that's crippled major studios.

For too long, gamers have been told their preferences don't matter. 

With xAI's entrance, the market will finally determine whether players want political lectures or engaging entertainment.

"In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore took on a challenge that few politicians dared to confront: cutting the size of the federal government.

Facing a ballooning deficit and mounting inefficiencies, Clinton announced an ambitious plan to slash wasteful spending, shrink bureaucracy, and rein in government overreach. He signed an executive order eliminating 100,000 federal jobs, a 12% cut in administrative costs, and the consolidation or termination of hundreds of outdated programs.

One of his biggest warnings? If wasteful spending wasn‚Äôt controlled, the federal deficit would soar to $650 billion per year by the early 2000s, with a growing share of tax dollars going toward interest payments on debt instead of public investment.

Fast forward to today. In 2024, the federal deficit stands at $1.83 trillion‚Äînearly triple Clinton‚Äôs worst-case scenario. Interest on the debt alone has reached $880 billion, consuming an ever-larger portion of the national budget.

Clinton‚Äôs reforms worked during his presidency. The federal workforce shrank by 380,000 federal jobs‚Äîa 16% decrease. Programs were streamlined, waste was reduced, and deficits were brought under control. 

Yet, decades later‚Äîafter the War on Terror, the 2008 financial crisis, and COVID-19‚Äîgovernment spending has soared once again, bureaucracy has expanded, and the national debt has reached historic highs. 

Now, history is repeating itself. President Trump has appointed Elon Musk, widely regarded as the world's most successful CEO and technologist, to lead efforts to streamline the government and restore fiscal responsibility.

For the sake of America, I hope the Democratic Party and the corporate media can set aside their irrational opposition and support DOGE, just as they once backed Bill Clinton and Al Gore.",2025-02-17 18:11:33+00:00

"Most are aware of Norm Eisen but not everyone is aware of just how pervasive Eisen (and his legal attacks) have been - and how he's weaved his way through all the major events of the last eight years.

After Ben Wittes first invoked the use of Lawfare against Trump (a month before the 2016 election), Eisen responded by ramping up his legal efforts at Brookings - and soon became the effective outside legal counsel for Mueller‚Äôs special counsel investigation. Eisen even developed specific legal strategies for Mueller to use. 

Before Mueller's report was even released Eisen shifted seamlessly to impeachment counsel for House Dems - where he drafted ten different articles of impeachment against Trump. All of which were written a month before Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry into Trump.

Eisen continued his work - re-aligning with CREW (he was co-founder).  Eisen also participated in and directed pre-election wargames that mysteriously predicted the election outcome with eerie precision.

Eisen was also working with another longtime collaborator, Michael Podhorzer, on Dem efforts in the 2020 election. Podhorzer has been called the Architect of the 2020 election.

Eisen then moved on to seemingly direct all the legal cases against Trump. Eisen appears to have written (on background) many of the drafts for Fani Willis - and developed many of the strategic attacks for Jack Smith.

It‚Äôs not us saying this. Eisen‚Äôs published multiple volumes on each section I‚Äôve mentioned through Brookings Institute whee he‚Äôs a senior fellow.   

Eisen‚Äôs also directly tied in - and working with - Mary McCord and her lawfare group at Georgetown.  They reportedly meet weekly by phone - and their group includes all the msnbc legal talking heads.

A known area of specific focus is restricting Trump's use of the Insurrection Act to quell violent protests & riots. 

Eisen also has a new working group called State Democracy Defenders Action acting in conjunction with his lawfare partners and most of the media‚Äôs legal talking heads. And it looks like they're trying to push a Color Revolution in response to Trump‚Äôs new presidency.

Eisen has recently been bragging on MSNBC about his role in getting an activist judge to temporarily rule against DOGE.

"HOW WOKE POLITICS TOOK OVER GAMING

Once upon a time, video games were about escapism, creativity, and fun. Now, they've been hijacked by the woke mind virus, turning them into preachy, sanctimonious vehicles for social justice propaganda. 

Gone are the days when you could just enjoy a game for its gameplay, story, or art. 

Now, every title feels obligated to serve up lectures on diversity, equity, and inclusion, whether you want it or not. 

Characters are no longer crafted for the narrative but shoehorned in to check off diversity boxes, often with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. 

Remember when villains were just villains, not coded representations of societal ills? 

Now, every antagonist must embody some real-world prejudice, turning every narrative into a thinly veiled sermon rather than a story. 

And let's not forget the gamers themselves - accused of bigotry for merely preferring the classics or for daring to critique the new, forced inclusivity.

The woke virus has sucked the joy out of gaming. Instead of innovation in gameplay or pushing the boundaries of graphics and storytelling, we're stuck with games that prioritize virtue signaling over creating memorable experiences. 

Developers are more concerned with their social media clout and review scores on inclusivity checklists than with the actual quality of their product.

"This is disturbing ‚Äì Biden and Obama Democrats created a new beast, the ‚Äúpopup nonprofit shell‚Äù they suddenly launch to take in your taxpayer money supposedly for things like climate change and illegal immigration. Major front for taxpayer abuse with accusations of grift growing by the hour. Never saw it like this in decades covering IRS/taxes.
¬†
Check out the tax returns for one of these popup NGO shells, the Climate United Fund which got the biggest nonprofit grant in history out of Biden‚Äôs massive climate slush funds.
¬†
Kamala Harris and Biden‚Äôs EPA chief Michael Regan gave $7 billion total¬†to the suddenly created Climate United Fund in April 2024 after it launched just five months earlier in November 30, 2022 when Its tax returns show it started with a tiny $547K in revs.

But it spent a massive $451K of that $547k in just two months in 2023, a quarter of that on legal fees and the majority $323K mysteriously blown on no one knows what because its tax returns don‚Äôt say.
¬†
It has no stipulated plans for how it will spend your $7B in tax $$, just ephemeral solar projects in Idaho, Arkansas, and Oregon that amount to only about $50M total, a fraction of the $7B. It also gave money out of that $7b to Power Forward Communities linked to Stacey Abrams.
¬†
It has little to no details on how much its officers get paid that you typically see on NGO 990s, in fact virtually no details, red flags that it‚Äôs a shell.

It supposedly is a partnership betw Dem insiders at investment firm Calvert Impact Capital, Community Preservation Corp. and a group called ‚ÄúSelf-Help‚Äù (irony noted). 
¬†
Beth Bafford is its CEO, a former ‚Äúspecial assistant‚Äù in Obama‚Äôs OMB and a regional field director for the Obama Campaign. 
¬†
As we tweeted about a month ago, it has ties to Democratic Party of California chairman and California State Treasurer Phil Angelides, Obama‚Äôs Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, United Farm Workers of America co-founder Dolores Huerta and Patrice Willoughby of the Congressional Black Caucus.

Judge Glock, the Director of Research and Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute, noted on X that the Climate United Fund got your $7B ater submitting a small 49-page report. That was all it took.

"The Department of Justice is investigating the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion program that was part of Joe Biden‚Äôs $740 billion Inflation Reduction Act. Created in the spring of 2023, and managed by the Environmental Protection Agency, the fund was supposed to be a ‚Äúfirst-of-its-kind‚Äù program to address the climate crisis while revitalizing communities that it considered ‚Äúhistorically left behind.‚Äù

But it appears little of the $27 billion revitalized anything‚Äîexcept the coffers of a range of environmental nonprofits associated with former Obama and Biden administration officials.

‚ÄúThe Biden administration used so-called ‚Äòclimate equity‚Äô to justify handouts of billions of dollars to their far-left friends,‚Äù @leezeldin, the Trump administration‚Äôs new EPA administrator, told @TheFP. ‚ÄúIt is my utmost priority to get a handle on every dollar that went out the door in this scheme and once again restore oversight and accountability over these funds. This rush job operation is riddled with conflicts of interest and corruption.‚Äù

A Free Press investigation reveals that of the $27 billion, $20 billion was rushed out the door to eight nonprofit groups after Biden lost the election‚Äîbut before President Donald Trump took office. As one former EPA official put it on a secretly recorded video, it was akin to ‚Äútossing gold bars off the Titanic.‚Äù

The eight groups were allocated sums ranging from $400 million to $6.9 billion. Several of them were formed in August of 2023, just one month after the grant applications went live in July of 2023, when it became clear that large nine- and 10-figure grants would be up for grabs. The boards and staff of these eight groups include Democratic donors, people with connections to the Obama and Biden administrations, and prominent Democrats like Stacey Abrams.

"Narrative # 1: DOGE‚Äôs ""slash-and-burn"" approach has eliminated thousands of federal jobs, causing hardship for workers, including veterans, and creating ""tremendous anxiety"" (CBS News, Business Insider).

Truth: 

1. Reports like Newsweek cite 18,000 IRS and 10,000 USPS layoffs, but this is a fraction of the 2.3 million federal workforce‚Äî less than 5%. This isn‚Äôt a gutting but a trimming of excess.

2. Anecdotal ""anxiety"" (e.g., Murkowski‚Äôs quote) lacks data showing widespread economic ruin. Federal workers often receive severance or transition to private roles, cushioned by a strong job market.

3. Claims of veteran harm are unproven‚ÄîEnergy Department layoffs spared critical nuclear staff, and no mass veteran layoffs are documented.

4. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has long flagged duplicative roles‚Äîe.g., 94 programs across 11 agencies for STEM education cost $3 billion annually with little coordination (GAO, 2018). DOGE‚Äôs cuts target such redundancies.

5. With interest on the $35 trillion debt exceeding $1 trillion yearly (CBO projections), each redundant job‚Äîsay, $80,000/year‚Äîcompounds the burden. Cutting 100,000 jobs could save $8 billion annually, a small but critical dent.

6. Streamlining bloated agencies like the IRS, which struggles with backlogs despite staffing, ensures taxpayer dollars fund results

- The unions
- The media
- The politicians
- The judges

It allowed

- Foreign policy establishment can fund groups that effectively work with prosecutors domestically or that work at media, dual sort of dual use
- To give them foreign grants to do media propaganda abroad but they operate here, or social media censorship to coerce foreign countries to pass foreign censorship laws that explicitly and are intended to attack US social media companies and in US peer-to-peer speech

"I was a lifelong Democrat. I thought most conservatives were ignorant or evil or lying. I believed almost everything written in the New York Times, The New Republic, and the Atlantic. I was horrified when conservatives criticized the authorities. Every criticism I saw: I thought all of it was motivated by animus, resentment, self-interest, or ignorance.

Whatever truth there might have been in the criticism, I saw as a mere ""half-truth"": an exploitation of this or that cherrypicked fact being weaponized. Why did I see it in terms of weaponization? Because I was biased: I saw liberal establishment institutions and figures as fundamentally good, so all criticism of them was automatically interpreted as being in bad faith.

Didn't the critics know that these institutions or figures were fundamentally good? If they didn't, they were ignorant. If they did, they were evil. It was that simple. This meant that any legitimate criticisms would just be dismissed, as if bouncing off of an impenetrable bulletproof shield.

This all changed once I started writing about the pandemic. Soon people started talking about me the way I once thought about conservatives. This led to a complete identity collapse as I came to understand that my old worldview was hateful and ignorant, that I hadn't understood what I had been judging.

I cannot forget the hearing that led to my dismissal from medical school a year after I started writing. During the hearing, people talked about me as if I wasn't human. My behavior was interpreted in the worst possible light. Complete fabrications were created. Nobody was concerned with the truth, only horrified at my apparent ""unprofessional behavior"", which was really a mirror of their unprofessional behavior directed at me. They structured the hearing to make it virtually impossible for me to speak and explain that what was being said was a lie. And nobody seemed to have any problem with this. Why? Because I was bad. If I am bad, then every mistreatment and every violation of the school's own policies became justified. A person who is bad does not deserve any rights. They only deserve punishment.

But the thing I remember most was the allusions to my social media activity. They said, ""Kevin is driven by resentment from his childhood."" I wasn't. I was on good terms with my parents. They alleged that I needed psychotherapy to deal with this trauma. It was a completely fake story that they had constructed about me, to demean me, to marginalize me, to try to explain the views I had expressed: that something terribly wrong had happened during the pandemic. They couldn't imagine that I might have legitimate points. So they reduced me to the same kinds of psychological caricatures that I once reduced conservatives to in my own mind.

When I was dismissed, I was broken. But I had help from friends who helped me understand what happened. And I came to realize that a hysteria had overtaken the left. I spent a lot of time reading about show trials, about witch trials, and so on. I also connected with people who had experienced similar things and came to realize that something similar had happened to hundreds of physicians around the country. My story wasn't unique. It was all the same story over and over again.

I cannot believe the person I once was. I cannot believe that I could exist like that. I still don't understand how I could be like that, or how millions of people in this country could continue being like that. It disturbs me greatly.

One thing I know is that whatever this thing is that is driving people crazy needs to be destroyed. It is hostile to civilization and to our humanity. It causes us to dehumanize each other and try to destroy each other. It is the very same monstrous thing that I once attributed to conservatives. But it had been inside me, and I could now see it inside others. This is something I still grapple with.",2025-03-17 01:17:13+00:00

"As much as last night was an indictment of the Democratic Party for misleading party members and the country about the mental acuity and health of the president, the media deserve far more derision and scorn. 

I and others were repeatedly criticized by the media for questioning the competency of the president. Among other false accusations, I was accused of spreading misleading videos which clearly showed Biden‚Äôs deterioration. 

Do you remember the heavily excerpted and edited @POTUS Biden @60Minutes interview where the interviewer covered for the president by saying he was ‚Äòvery tired?‚Äô

@60Minutes knew. 

The @nytimes knew. 

@CNN knew. 

@MSNBC knew. 

Left wing media have had total and complete access to the president, his staff, and his administration. 

They all knew, but they told you otherwise. They outright lied to you. 

When Robert Hur, the special counsel who deposed the president, said that the president was not fit to stand trial and therefore chose not to bring charges, the media described him as a tool of the Republican Party and character assassinated him. 

When the @WSJ recently published a several-thousand-word, carefully researched, front page piece on the president‚Äôs mental and physical health, it was described by left wing media as outright propaganda. 

Now consider who has been feeding you propaganda. 

A favored technique of some of the most evil leaders in history was to mislead the people by constantly repeating the Big Lie. 

The Big Lie is so audacious that people accept it as truth because it is repeated so often that how can it be that something so important and material could be an outright falsehood?

In this case the Big Lie was our president‚Äôs fitness for office, let alone a second term. 

A media organization is not supposed to be a branch of the Democratic Party. 

The media have a profound obligation to tell the truth to the American people, particularly about something as critical for the country as the president‚Äôs mental and physical health. 

People very close to me, my closest family and friends, trusted the media on Biden until the @CNN commentators finally owned up to the truth about Biden last night. 

For months I have been accused by many friends and family of being misled by an @X-based ‚Äòright wing echo chamber.‚Äô

The sad reality is that one of our most important institutions, the so-called ‚ÄòFourth Estate,‚Äô fourth only after the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners, has destroyed any remaining credibility it has. 

Consider how your perception of @POTUS Biden and @realDonaldTrump has been manipulated. 

The media can no longer save itself. 

A suggestion. Rely on empirical data as much as possible. Listen to what someone actually said, rather than a headline summary or article about what someone said. 

Get your news from people who have a track record of telling the truth, people who do so at significant personal cost like whistleblowers. 

I follow broad constituencies on @X on multiple issues. That has led me closer to the truth. Citizen journalism has been a much more accurate representation of reality.

"@aelluswamy summarized the past decade very well.

When I hopped in my friend‚Äôs model S in 2015, it hit me in a weird way: that car was running software all around, had a nice big touch screen (finally, an actual ‚Äúscreen‚Äù), was receiving frequent feature updates over the air, and came with a mobile app for essential remote controls. How could a big car company build something like this? Didn‚Äôt make sense back then (and still today for many).
 
My interview with the Autopilot team early 2016 was very different than most interviews I‚Äôd ever taken. We first had a technical discussion on something I had built before, with several engineers and the executive in charge of the group at the time. An actual white board chat where we were all bouncing ideas on the matter together. The only places I‚Äôd ever seen the face of anyone above, at best, a team lead during interviews was at some small startups.
 
Every 1:1 interview that followed was similarly practical. Real coding situations you‚Äôd encounter as an engineer, not useless LeetCode trick questions typically found in other big companies‚Äô interviews. When we got done, the recruiter walked me through the office. Everyone was sitting literally next to each other: autopilot software, hardware, vehicle firmware, and many other teams interacting live without friction. Eventually, we walked past @elonmusk's desk and he was sitting right there, next to the engineering teams. Not in any separate ivory tower.
 
One week in the job, and I was already in a team meeting with him brainstorming Autopilot technical challenges, exactly how it went during my interview. And that went on almost every single week, for the 8+ years that followed. 

It soon became pretty clear that Elon was directly behind that culture of pragmatic innovation, percolating through all aspects of the company.
 
Week after week, I‚Äôve witnessed that relentless drive to build features that make people‚Äôs lives better and safer, removing roadblocks and unnecessary layers one after another, systematically drilling down to the fundamental ‚Äúwhy‚Äù - all of this while sleeping at the factory during Model 3 production hell, designing new vehicles, working on BOM reductions, and launching new factories across the globe. During that entire time, through all these chapters, news headlines and other difficult company-wide moments, and while landing rockets on drone ships in the ocean, Elon was still sitting with us in a room every week, often more, with the only objective of building things that will change humanity for the better.
 
When he announced Tesla would soon start a humanoid robotics program to fuel a future of abundance at AI Day 2021, many once again laughed and doubted. Two years into the program, and Tesla is actively testing early versions of what could well be the first full-fledged humanoid robots equipped with articulated hands autonomously conducting real tasks in a real factory via an end-to-end neural net, running entirely on the bot‚Äôs compute hardware. And again, using 2D cameras only.
 
Whether at Tesla or not, I‚Äôd say the same: without Elon, none of any of these amazing things would have ever happened. I can only imagine what a lesser future we‚Äôd be living without his involvement and dedication.

There have been many attempts to build a reusable rocket system, but they have always been canceled once they discovered that success was not one of the possible outcomes.

"Government mandated dating: The drop in birth rates is the ""gravest crisis our country faces,"" said Japan's Kishida, as the Japanese government launches new measures to boost the birth rate. 

Tokyo has launched a dating app in a bid set to promote marriage and combat Japan's declining birthrate. The app aims to provide a secure platform for singles looking to tie the knot, with a thorough registration process requiring proof of single status and a commitment to marriage.

Sharing Elon Musk's point of view, Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has called the drop in birth rates the ""gravest crisis our country faces"" and has unveiled a range of measures to support child-bearing households. 

The government has allocated a substantial amount of money to promote marriages through apps and other projects. 

To sign up for the app, users will need to provide detailed personal information, including height, education, occupation, and even a tax certificate to verify their annual salary. The government's involvement is expected to instill a sense of security and encourage hesitant individuals to take the first step in finding a partner.

The initiative comes as Japan faces a critical situation, with births falling for the eighth consecutive year and the population expected to decline by 30% by 2070. Tokyo, in particular, has the highest unmarried rates for 50-year-olds in the country, with 32% of men and 24% of women remaining single.

With the launch of this government-backed dating app, Tokyo hopes to provide the necessary ""gentle push"" for the 70% of people who desire marriage but have been hesitant to actively seek a partner.",2024-06-05 10:43:00+00:00

"CNN Senior Legal Analyst Describes How The Trump Conviction Was A Political Hit Job

1. ""The judge donated money... in plain violation of a rule prohibiting New York judges from making political donations‚Äîto a pro-Biden, anti-Trump political operation.""

2. Alvin Bragg boasted on the campaign trail in an overwhelmingly Democrat county, ‚ÄúIt is a fact that I have sued Trump over 100 times.‚Äù

3. ""Most importantly, the DA‚Äôs charges against Trump push the outer boundaries of the law and due process.""

4. ""The charges against Trump are obscure, and nearly entirely unprecedented. In fact, no state prosecutor ‚Äî in New York, or Wyoming, or anywhere ‚Äî has ever charged federal election laws as a direct or predicate state crime, against anyone, for anything. None. Ever.""

5. The DA inflated misdemeanors past the statute of limitations and ""electroshocked them back to life"" by alleging the falsification of business records was committed 'with intent to commit another crime.'

6. ""Inexcusably, the DA refused to specify what those unlawful means actually were ‚Äî and the judge declined to force them to pony up ‚Äî until right before closing arguments. So much for the constitutional obligation to provide notice to the defendant of the accusations against him in advance of trial.""

7. ""In these key respects, the charges against Trump aren‚Äôt just unusual. They‚Äôre bespoke, seemingly crafted individually for the former president and nobody else.""

8. ""The Manhattan DA‚Äôs employees reportedly have called this the ‚ÄúZombie Case‚Äù because of various legal infirmities, including its bizarre charging mechanism. But it‚Äôs better characterized as the Frankenstein Case, cobbled together with ill-fitting parts into an ugly, awkward, but more-or-less functioning contraption that just might ultimately turn on its creator.""

"San Francisco‚Äôs Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing (HSH) has seen a sharp uptick in funding since 2020. Much of the revenue came from 2018's Prop C, a tax targeting SF tech companies. 

Voters were assured the measure would reduce homelessness with a minimal impact on jobs. For example: 

‚Ä¢ SF city economist Ted Egan told Curbed SF in Sept 2018 that Prop C would reduce homelessness and result in a 0.1 percent decline in employment growth 

‚Ä¢ In an Oct 2018 NYTimes op-ed, Marc Benioff wrote that ""[Prop C] funding will address the [homeless] crisis from every angle.‚Äù 

But since the tax went into effect, a larger budget for HSH hasn‚Äôt translated into fewer homeless in SF. Instead, according to newly released data, the city‚Äôs overall homeless population has increased by 7% since 2022. And an audit of the HSH from earlier this month found HSH continues to fail to adequately track how it's spending money.

At the same time, a number of tech companies have left the city, significantly reduced their SF headcounts, or vacated their SF offices. These include Stripe, Block, Paypal, Coinbase, Credit Karma, Meta, Snap, and ironically, Salesforce. Between Feb 2023 and Feb 2024 alone, San Francisco and San Mateo counties lost 14,300 information sector jobs. 

‚ÄúTech is actually much worse than [projected] before,‚Äù Egan told The Standard in March. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no sign of it recovering at this point.‚Äù

"One thing that has become clear to me in recent weeks is that some brokerages and institutions holding shares, especially those outside the U.S., make it way too difficult for individual stockholders to vote their shares. In some cases, people can't even vote at all.

I've been trying to help countless people through direct messages (others like @TeslaBoomerMama have too), but the number of obstacles some people face just to vote is crazy, and I can only help to an extent. Fortunately, voting is relatively easy with most U.S. brokerages.

Historically, retail shareholder participation in these annual shareholder meetings is quite low, but I get the sense that won't be the case this time. In all my years as a Tesla shareholder, I've never seen the retail base this involved.

"In 2018, Tesla $TSLA was worth just under $60 billion. They signed a 10-year CEO extension & compensation deal with @elonmusk , which offered him *zero base compensation*, but up to $55 billion in compensation if, and only if, he could more than *10x the company's value* to $650 billion, a feat no CEO has ever accomplished.

By 2020, less than 3 years later, Tesla did indeed hit a $650 billion market cap, despite the skeptics who literally called it ""laughably impossible"" when the plan was publicized.

Now, the Delaware courts are shooting down that compensation package, citing that the Board of Directors were not truly independent and that shareholders weren't aware of the Board's relationship with Musk.

"This is the problem.

You've been told over and over that gamers are full of hate for people, and that's why they hate DEI in games. You've been lied to so many times you literally assume this to be the truth. You don't get it, at all. It's never been the point, but we've been tarred and feathered with these lies because you want to cancel us, get us fired, or pushed out of the community. Evil, reprehensible tactics like you are using RIGHT NOW.

Gamers don't care. We don't care who are you, where you come from, so long as you stop forcing it on us and trying to make everything and everyone always be ABOUT YOU. We've ALWAYS been welcoming because we were the outcast geeks and we understand. YOU exploited that to get into our groups and then start demanding things change just to cater to you and for US to leave.

We DO care if you are forcing DEI into games to the detriment of the game or to the beratement of players. DEI often masks as virtue, but is just used as a narrative tool in games to belittle or hate on non-POC like whites and asians or straight men. We are endlessly lecture by how toxic we are just for existing, and how everyone else is soooo much more superior.

The games infected devolved. Most often with stories being filled with cringe dialog (""I need to do a barve"") or characters that oddly feel compelled to announce their sexuality for no reason other than to promote some kind of forced representation. Worse yet are the characters who are solely defined by their gonads and when writers create entire story arcs about it, while yelling and screeching to the rest of us about how oppressed you are, that it's OUR fault, and that we MUST do something FOR you.

Game design, code and production also suffers, as DEI hires based on skin and gender for soft quotas are stuffed into roles which they are not ready for, because merit has been completely abandoned. Bug proliferate, game design goes bland or broken, and teams stumble along in execution taking too much time and budget. Worse yet, skilled devs are passed over for promotion, because they are ""white men"", or hounded by their co-workers for their conservative opinions and held back because of them. They leave the industry, leaving the NON merit hires behind trying to figure out things on their own without the skills, talent, or institutional knowledge.

So no, a non-binary VA is not some kind of ""gotcha"" in Monster Hunter Wilds. Nobody cares so long as DEI didn't make the game worse, pander and propagandize the story, drain characters of their depth, or lecture and berate us.

Nobody cares. You are losing, and these tactics of yours just aren't effective anymore. Good day, sir.",2025-03-02 15:28:19+00:00

This is the kind of thing that if a public company did it, the company would be delisted and the executive team would be thrown in prison -- but this is normal at the Government. 

We recommended the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to make payment categorization codes mandatory and there needs to be an explanation, ANY explanation, above nothing. That's a radical change to the system that is being implemented now.

If you adjusted these numbers to reflect that the Chinese typically sell comparable items cheaper, the magnitude of Chinese manufacturing would be even more striking. (By the way, I thought Grok‚Äôs answer and analysis on this were great.)

While we‚Äôre exchanging thoughts, I think that if we don‚Äôt get the US budget deficit down to about 3% of GDP, there will be too much supply of US bonds relative to the demand for them, which will produce real problems.

The NGO, co-founded by Norm Eisen, calls itself the ‚ÄúStates United Democracy Center,‚Äù and all they could manage with that $17 million was about 200 views per episode of their knockoff muppet show.

‚ÄúThey got money, and they did something with that. It was just awful. Jim Henson would roll in his grave. And it was weird because all the videos have less than 200 views. They didn‚Äôt even try to promote them with ads or anything. So where did the $17 million go?‚Äù

"ELON: THE WOKE MIND VIRUS IS CREATING AN ARTIFICIAL MENTAL CIVIL WAR  

‚ÄúTo summarize the woke mind virus, it consists of creating very, very divisive identity politics. 

 It actually amplifies racism, it amplifies sexism and all the -isms, while claiming to do the opposite.  

It actually divides people and makes them hate each other, and it makes people hate themselves.  

It's also anti-meritocratic, it's not merit-based.  

You want to have people succeed based on how hard they work and their talents, not who they are, whether they're a man, woman, what race or gender.  

It's an artificial mental civil war that is created.  And let me tell you, it's no fun.  

Woke mind virus and fun are incompatible.  There's no fun in that, no joy.  

The woke mind virus is all about condemning people instead of celebrating people.

Rep Darrell Issa has introduced the No Rogue Rulings Act (NORRA) to stop federal judges from issuing nationwide injunctions that derail a president‚Äôs agenda. 

Instead, rulings would only apply to the parties in the case‚Äîno more one-judge veto power over the White House.

 Trump‚Äôs policies have been hit with over 50 lawsuits challenging more than 60 executive actions.

Issa:

""The founders could never have envisioned judges and part of the legislative branch teaming up to tie down the executive and disempower the people. 

The current judge-shopping climate in the United States amounts to judicial tyranny and a weaponization of courts.""

The bill has strong GOP backing and is expected to pass and land on Trump‚Äôs desk.

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt:

""We believe these judges are acting as judicial activists rather than honest arbiters of the law and they have issued at least 12 injunctions against this administration in the past 14 days, often without citing any evidence or grounds for their lawsuits.

This is part of a larger concerted effort by Democrat activists, and nothing more than the continuation of the weaponization of justice against President Trump.""

"When I was County Judge Executive in Lewis County Kentucky, I was responsible for signing the check that paid for every phone landline and cellphone billed to the county.

At first it seemed impossible to ferret out the waste, fraud, and abuse for these phone plans.

How many phones were taxpayers paying for that were defunct? How many were former county employees who were no longer employed but had been able to keep their phone and mooch off the taxpayer? Was any of it fraudulent or inaccurate billing by the service provider?

But then I came up with an idea‚Ä¶ I told every county department (Sheriff, Clerk, Road Crew, Jail, etc.) to give me a list of their phones matched to their county employees or offices.

In one month, I would DEACTIVATE EVERY PHONE that wasn‚Äôt on one of these lists.

A month went by and only about 80% complied with the directive to list their phones. I gave them one more month and issued a serious warning that their phones would be turned off at the end of the next month.

Finally, I directed the phone company to deactivate all phones that weren‚Äôt accounted for. Guess what?

The jailer called me up and said the finger print machine wouldn‚Äôt send finger prints to the state police anymore. Ha! That was the only legitimate phone line that I deactivated. We quickly got it reactivated.

I ended up saving our county thousands of dollars on the phone bill, much to the chagrin of the phone company and a few moochers who no longer had free phone plans. I think most of the savings came from phones that just weren‚Äôt in service but had been left on the bill.

Why do I tell this story? Because what Elon is doing by asking federal employees to list five things they did in a week is brilliant. Requiring any kind of an affirmative response from a worker will prove whether that worker even exists and can be reached. Don‚Äôt forget, the Inspector General for Afghanistan found out we were paying millions for soldiers and police in Afghanistan who didn‚Äôt even exist (ghost employees). There‚Äôs no telling what Elon‚Äôs plan will uncover. We will find some employees can‚Äôt use email or aren‚Äôt even literate enough to write five things. So everyone take a chill pill and write down your five things to let us know you exist and you can read email and you aren‚Äôt completely insubordinate. Then we can clean the roster.",2025-02-25 13:47:13+00:00
"I'm  concerned that many people do not understand the historical and institutional context in which the DOGE labor reforms are unfolding. They look at this as if these are some random, chaotic, arbitrary, strange, and even cruel measures to impose on a devoted civil service. 

The reality is very different, and I'm not even sure that Elon entirely understands this. For more than a century, even dating back to 1883, the civil service has grown and grown without check from the elected branch, either the presidency or the legislature . The bureaucracies have ballooned from a few to 450 or so. The bloat and absurdities have grown too. 

Get this: no one has ever known what to do about it. Not Coolidge, not Hoover, not Nixon, not Reagan, not Clinton, no one. No president has been able to crack this nut. The only reforms ever to have made it through are those that make the administrative state bigger, never smaller. 

Countless cabinet secretaries have come and gone, always with the intention of making a change but leaving saddened, demoralized, outwitted, outgunned, and ultimately devoured. 

No president has seriously taken on this problem because they simply did not know how. The unions are powerful, the intimidation from the deep institutional knowledge is overwhelming, the fear of the media as been powerful, and every single president comes to power vaguely feeling threatened by the intelligence agencies. The industries that have captured every single agency were also far too powerful to unseat or control. 

This combination of institutional inertia has blocked serious reform for a full century. No one has dared. No one has even had a theory or strategy about what to do about this problem. It had become so terrible that most people in politics have simply surrendered, like homeowners who know there are rats in the basement and bats in the attic but long ago gave up trying to fix the issue. 

All this time, the American people have felt themselves ever more oppressed, weighed upon, taxed and regulated, spied upon, brow beaten, and otherwise overwhelmed. Voting never made any difference because the politicians no longer controlled the system. The bureaucracies ruled all. 

The Biden years underscored the point. We didn't even need a conscious and present executive. We only needed a figurehead to pretend to be president, just like the Soviet premiers in the old days. The institutions ran everything and the people controlled nothing. 

How to deal with this? Trump alone figured it out in his last term: he simply took charge of the agencies in a limited way. There were screams of horror and plots galore. They performed a long stream of clever schemes to destroy him and show him who is boss, which is not the democratically elected president but the forces behind the scenes. 

The job of the president, goes the message from all the insiders, is to PRETEND to be in charge but not actually do anything meaningful. Shut up, mug up, obey, and disturb nothing, let the administrative state do its thing without oversight or disruption, and then you will get your honorary library and bestselling autobiography and go down in history as great. 

Trump refused the deal and look what happened. 

Four years have gone by and Trump is back again, this time with a determination to slay this beast, one that he knows all-to-well. The efforts of DOGE and MAHA and MAGA are epic in scope, breaking a century of pathetic acquiescence toward the deep, middle, and shallow states, at last using moral courage to confront the problem head on, come what may. 

They are profoundly aware that they MUST act fast and with some degree of ferocity, even recklessness, else we will default back to the status quo of leaders who pretend to be in charge while the embedded system runs things behind the scenes. 

It has been this way for TOO LONG. The voters this time have demanded change, and mustered the faith to believe that change is possible. This is precisely what DOGE is attempting, to make good on a promise, a promise that for once the voters actually believed was credible. 

They simply must succeed. There might never be another chance. The way of failure is the path everyone knows the US was on, toward economic stagnation, political scolerosis, and eventual irrelevance in the unfolding of the next stage of social evolution.",2025-02-23 22:18:04+00:00

TSA Under Biden Focused on Speeding Up Checkpoints for Illegal Aliens Without IDs, Not National Security

During the Biden Administration, expediting TSA security checkpoints took precedence over national security concerns. Through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit I filed after TSA stonewalled my initial request‚ÄîI‚Äôve exclusively obtained the protocols that allowed illegal aliens to board commercial flights with IDs under Biden‚Äôs watch. TSA officials claimed these documents didn‚Äôt exist during his tenure, but the Trump Administration has since granted me access to this information.

On March 26, 2021, TSA issued ‚Äúa revised Operations Directive to address a significant increase in the number of non-U.S. citizens at certain airports who do not have acceptable ID documents.‚Äù

The OD added a series of DHS-provided documents that were suddenly acceptable for illegal aliens traveling without IDs. Here‚Äôs the list of those documents that were suddenly deemed acceptable:

-Warrant for Arrest of Alien

-Warrant of Removal/Deportation

-Order of Removal on Recognizance

-Order of Supervision

-Notice to Appear

-Arrival and Departure Form

-Alien Booking Record

These documents could be displayed electronically at TSA security checkpoints, meaning an illegal alien could present a photo or screenshot on their device, and TSA agents were permitted to grant them passage.

On April 2021, TSA rolled out a CBP One Pilot program. That program was led by Director of Aviation Coordination Julian E Williams and Director of Capability Management and Innovation Requirements and Capability Analysis Melissa Conley.

The primary goal of the pilot program wasn‚Äôt tied to national security but rather to reduce wait times at TSA security checkpoints. This focus is emphasized repeatedly throughout the Concept of Operations.

In the document, TSA says the influx of illegals without IDs ‚Äúplaces a severe burden on TSA checkpoints when attempting to vet multiple individuals.‚Äù

The document goes on to brag about reducing the wait times since rolling this pilot program out, ‚Äúuse of CBP OneTM also resulted in an efficiency improvement in process cycle time over the IVCC procedures. The average cycle time for ID verification with CBP OneTMwas 1.48 minutes as compared to an average IVCC cycle time of 12.87 minutes, an 88.50% reduction of average cycle time per individual.‚Äú‚ÄúCBP OneTM, TSA partnered with CBP to investigate adapting the app for use by TSA as a viable, effective, and efficient operational alternative solution to validate travel documentation for adult non-U.S. citizens with valid boarding passes who are not in possession of acceptable travel documents and are subject to ID validation.‚Äù

The pilot program allowed ‚ÄúTSA personnel use a TSA-issued smartphone equipped with the CBP OneTM app to take a photograph of that individual and transmit the biometric through the app for comparison with CBP records.‚Äù

The CBP One Pilot also advised illegal aliens that the capturing of their facial biometrics was optional. According to the Patriot Act, all non-U.S. citizens must submit their biometrics to DHS.

Here are a list of the airports that participated in the Pilot Program for CBP One:

-Alexandria International Airport, Louisiana (AEX)

-Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, Texas (AUS)

-Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, Texas (DFW)

-Denver International Airport, Colorado (DEN)

-Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Florida (FLL)

-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Texas (IAH)

Just one man and the Constitution, Article 2 has a clause known as the vesting clause, and it says the executive power shall be vested in a president, singular. 

The whole will of democracy is imbued into the elected president. That president then appoints staff to then impose that democratic will onto the government.

"Over the last few months, we've come to a realization that should have landed much harder: NGOs weren't just adjacent to government, they were the parallel government. We were shocked. I was too. But looking back, it's exactly what you'd expect. NGOs operate outside the chain of command. They answer to no electorate, no oversight, no public mandate. They can push any agenda they choose without accountability.

So the real question isn't how this happened, or even why. The real question is: why were we surprised? The moment Biden took office, the plan was already in motion. NGOs had the infrastructure, the logistics, the funding pipelines; everything ready to go. They didn't need permission. They just needed power. And when they got it, they had it all set up from day 1: overnight, we were flooded with illegal immigrants under the cover of a coordinated strategy that had been waiting in the wings.

I've been acting like this was some secret operation pulled off behind our backs. But it wasn't. I wasn't deceived; I just failed to see what was right in front of me. Because if you wanted to carry out a bloodless coup, this is exactly how you'd do it.",2025-04-13 03:36:29+00:00

"üá∫üá∏BUILT, NOT BOLTED: WHY TESLA IS TRULY AMERICAN-MADE

Tesla vehicles are proudly made in America, with a manufacturing process that emphasizes domestic production from the ground up. 

Unlike some automakers that assemble vehicles in the U.S using a significant portion of parts sourced globally, Tesla has built a vertically integrated system where the majority of its vehicles‚Äô components are designed, engineered, and produced in the United States. 

Tesla‚Äôs approach starts with its commitment to controlling the supply chain. 

At the Fremont Factory, which has been the heart of Tesla‚Äôs production since 2010, the company doesn‚Äôt just assemble cars - it manufactures critical components in-house. 

The process begins with raw materials like aluminum and steel, much of which is sourced from American suppliers. 

Tesla‚Äôs massive casting machines, including the Giga Press, transform these materials into large, single-piece structural components like the underbody of the Tesla Model Y. 

This die-casting process, pioneered by Tesla, reduces the need for hundreds of smaller parts that might otherwise be imported, ensuring that the vehicle‚Äôs foundation is made in America.

Battery production, the soul of any electric vehicle, is another area where Tesla stands out. 

While some automakers rely on battery cells shipped from Asia or Europe, Tesla produces its own at Gigafactory Nevada, in partnership with Panasonic. 

The facility churns out 2170 and 4680 battery cells - designed by Tesla engineers in California - using a mix of domestically sourced and processed materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt. 

These batteries are then shipped to Fremont or Texas, keeping the supply chain largely within U.S borders. 

Gigafactory Texas takes this further by integrating battery production on-site, directly feeding cells into vehicle assembly.

The electric motors, power electronics, and software that define Tesla‚Äôs performance are also American-made. 

Tesla designs and builds its motors at Fremont and Texas, using advanced manufacturing techniques like hairpin winding for efficiency. 

The accompanying inverters and control systems are produced in-house, with printed circuit boards and semiconductors assembled in the U.S, often leveraging chips from American firms like NVIDIA or Tesla‚Äôs own custom silicon. 

The software, from Autopilot to the user interface, is coded by Tesla‚Äôs teams in California and flashed onto vehicles during production.

Body and interior components further showcase Tesla‚Äôs domestic focus. 

The Fremont and Texas plants stamp, weld, and paint vehicle bodies using American steel and aluminum. 

Seats, glass (like the massive Model Y roof panels), and even smaller parts like wiring harnesses are increasingly produced in-house or by U.S-based suppliers, reducing reliance on foreign parts. 

Tesla‚Äôs paint shops, among the most advanced in the industry, apply uniquely American finishes - like the ‚ÄúGiga Texas Red‚Äù rumored for future models.

Assembly ties it all together on American soil. 

At Fremont, robots and human workers collaborate on a highly automated line, attaching batteries, motors, and interiors to freshly cast frames. 

Gigafactory Texas, with its sprawling 10-million-square-foot footprint, replicates and scales this process, producing the Model Y and Cybertruck. 

Every vehicle rolling off these lines is a testament to American engineering and labor - not a kit of foreign parts snapped together.

That‚Äôs not to say Tesla uses zero imported components. 

Some specialized electronics or rare materials still come from abroad due to global supply realities. 

However, the U.S International Trade Commission and automotive industry standards classify Tesla vehicles as overwhelmingly domestic, with North American content often exceeding 75% - well above the threshold for ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù bragging rights. 

Tesla‚Äôs investment in U.S. factories - over $17 billion across Fremont, Nevada, and Texas - underscores its commitment.

In short, Tesla vehicles aren‚Äôt just assembled in America; they‚Äôre born there. 

From molten metal to finished Cybertrucks, the process is a showcase of U.S innovation, manufacturing muscle, and a vision to keep production close to home.",2025-04-09 06:31:49+00:00

"In 1992, Congress quietly capped your shower at 2.5 gallons per minute. It was supposed to conserve water. Instead, it killed one of the simplest human joys. You know the feeling: lukewarm mist, high pressure but no weight.

The ‚Äúlow-flow‚Äù shower mandate was buried in a sweeping energy bill, justified in the name of environmental conservation. But decades later, data shows that low-flow laws actually make us take longer showers, increasing water waste (and making all of us unsatisfied as a result).

A shower isn‚Äôt just about hygiene. It‚Äôs restoration. Meditation. Recovery. It‚Äôs the one place you can be alone, warm, still. And it‚Äôs time we unlocked it. This 1992 law is one example in a string of misguided, scarcity-based solutions to problems that could be improved with better technology or management. Removing the federal standard would allow market dynamics to eventually land on the appropriate balance of flow-rate, pressure, cost to install, and cost to operate. It would also make us all a lot happier with our shower experience (and cleaner).

This has gone on long enough. Violent vigilantes like these only fester and grow when they're allowed to act with impunity like at UC Davis. Arrests need to be made. Radical anarchists will keep resorting to more and more violence if they think doing so will stop conservatives from speaking.

New research shows that spending less time in slow wave and REM sleep is tied to brain shrinkage in regions affected early in Alzheimer‚Äôs. 

Over 270 adults were tracked for 13 to 17 years. 

Less deep sleep meant smaller volumes in the inferior parietal cortex‚Äîa region vital for memory.

Gawon Cho, public health researcher:

""Reduced neuroactivity during sleep may contribute to brain atrophy, thereby potentially increasing the risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.""

Even after adjusting for health and lifestyle factors, sleep remained a powerful predictor.

"As a European, supporting Elon and X isn't always easy with the media constantly trashing him and X with their nonsense. Prepping my family Christmas dinner speech to set the record straight. 

Here are my notes for my fellow Europeans.

- Most of you rely on legacy media and haven‚Äôt actually listened to a long-form conversation with Musk. If you had, you‚Äôd know he‚Äôs not the ‚Äúcreepy billionaire‚Äù you‚Äôve been led to believe he is. He‚Äôs trying to understand the universe, the meaning of life, and what‚Äôs really going on. 
- Elon values truth and honesty. He strives to be as truthful as possible. If you stop listening to what the media says about him and start paying attention to what he actually says, you‚Äôll see this too.
- His bigger goal? Transitioning humanity into a multiplanetary civilization to extend the lifespan of consciousness. Why? To give us enough time to figure out the answers to the big questions.

Now about X:
- Free speech is the cornerstone of a functioning democracy. Open dialogue lets us share ideas, critique governments, and hold power accountable. X brought this back when it was slipping away faster than ever. It‚Äôs the single biggest recent contribution to democracy. How can you not agree with that?
- ‚ÄúBut people spread fake news on X!‚Äù --> COMMUNITY NOTES! It‚Äôs shocking how many people still don‚Äôt know about this. Community Notes is an open-sourced tool that adds context to potentially misleading posts. Notes are rated for helpfulness by contributors with diverse viewpoints, ensuring objectivity and broad agreement. No one is immune to it, not even Elon. It‚Äôs a proof point that X truly aspires to truth.
- Community Notes is the most powerful tool to combat fake news on social media, a massive societal challenge. So why isn‚Äôt your friend Mark Zuckerberg rolling this out across all his platforms immediately? Or why isn't he open-sourcing the home feed algorithm like X did?

A misunderstood innovator:
- Say what you want about him, but Elon gets things done. He built the first successful reusable rockets with SpaceX, revolutionized electric vehicles with Tesla, and is pushing solar energy. People doubted him every step of the way, but he consistently delivered on what most thought was impossible.
- He's motivated by challenges, not money: unlike most billionaires, Elon reinvests the majority of his wealth into solving problems like sustainable energy, space colonization, and AI safety. He doesn‚Äôt even live in a mansion, he rents a small house near SpaceX.

Broader context:
- The media hates him: Musk is a disruptor. Legacy institutions (media included) don‚Äôt like losing control, so they demonize him. The backlash against Musk is a reflection of these power struggles.
- X challenges monopolies: Social platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok operate as monopolies with little pushback. X is forcing them to innovate or become obsolete.
- Cultural shifts: X represents a shift away from performative ‚Äúsafe‚Äù spaces to real, open conversations. That‚Äôs uncomfortable for some but necessary for progress.

"Another TLDR coming your way. Having spent a decade as the founder and CEO of a defense aerospace company, I saw firsthand many of the inefficiencies in the system. That‚Äôs why I am genuinely excited about what @DOGE could accomplish.

As things inevitably change, it is healthy for any large enterprise to reorganize for maximum efficiency, productivity and agility. The United States really should be no different.

I believe there is plenty we can 'delete', consolidate and streamline while maintaining the core mission of our government agencies. For example, the intelligence community has 18 agencies reporting to several cabinet-level departments (Treasury, DOJ, DHS, DOE, DoD). While every function they perform is important to national security, would they be more effective if consolidated into fewer organizations? Streamlining could make it easier to disseminate information, improve collaboration and facilitate faster decision-making, which is critical in today‚Äôs threat environment.

Similarly, should the FDA and USDA remain separate entities when both oversee aspects of food and drug certification? Could a unified structure eliminate redundancies and better serve public health?

When it comes to homeland security, would agencies like TSA and CBP function more effectively under a single organizational structure? These questions aren‚Äôt about eliminating responsibilities but about ensuring taxpayers get the best outcomes with less bureaucratic overhead.

The DoD is another prime example where efficiency gains could be unlocked. While there are redundancies and overlaps that could be fixed, the real value lies in reforming acquisitions and contracting. Too many programs today take shockingly long and cost far too much. Contractors are incentivized to drag out cost+ programs due to limited competition and little pressure to challenge the status quo. This can be fixed.

Take the Gerald Ford-class aircraft carriers as an example. The first carrier was awarded in 2008, construction began in 2009, it was commissioned in 2017 and it didn‚Äôt deploy until 2022‚Äîat a cost of $18 billion (including R&D). The next carrier in the class, the JFK, will take at least 10 years from construction to commissioning and cost $12.5 billion. These timelines are staggering. During World War II, the USA built over 155 carriers in a handful of years. Or, for another perspective, these projects run longer than the time from Alan Shepard‚Äôs first suborbital flight to Neil Armstrong‚Äôs walk on the moon.

Contractors must be held to strict performance standards, with consequences for delays and overruns. If need be, we can break up the big primes, introduce more competition and the system will only improve. This is why we have antitrust laws. The best talent will change polo shirts and shift to more agile and effective companies-- excited to make a difference.

It should also be straightforward across all agencies to identify billions in expenses no rational person would defend. Who is actually working? Who has scanned in to a building, logged onto the VPN or accessed email? For every expense, there should be a clear justification and someone accountable for the obligation.

Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that taxpayers, warfighters, civil servants and the nation get the best products, services and capabilities‚Äîdelivered faster and for less cost. It is not just about saving money-- it is about ensuring our competitiveness and meeting the challenges of the future üá∫üá∏",2024-11-21 23:47:44+00:00

‚ÄúOne of the most profound things is that Starship 3 will cost less per flight than Falcon 1.¬†That's the difference between a fully reusable rocket or an expendable rocket.¬†

The fully reusable rocket with low-cost propellant and autogenous pressurization actually costs less than a tiny expendable rocket.¬†

Falcon 1 is about half a ton to orbit.¬†The Starship 3 will be 400 times more payload for less than the cost of a Falcon 1. Ultimately, I think we might be able to get the cost per flight to Earth orbit down to around $2 or $3 million.¬†

"EXCLUSIVE: NASA staff beg Elon Musk to 'clean house' after agency spent millions of Americans' money on DEI agenda | Daily Mail

NASA staff are calling on¬†Elon Musk¬†to 'clean house' as it is revealed the agency blew millions of taxpayer money on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.

Spending reports from 2020 to 2024 showed NASA awarded grants to universities and consulting firms to support 'environmental justice' and initiatives that 'embrace greater diversity and inclusive practices.'

LMI consulting received over $2 million in 2023 for NASA to 'embark on a venture to incorporate and deeply engrain diversity, inclusion, equity and accessibility in the culture and business.'

Another $3 million went to Booze Allen Hamilton in March to support NASA's 'office of diversity and equal opportunity DEI data analytic specialty,' and $ 7 million was announced last month for six 'minority-serving institutions.'

Amid these expenditures, staff have voiced concerns online about budget shortages, citing struggles with 'limited funds' due to 'wasteful spending.' Software engineer Kyle Sorensen told he hopes Musk will 'clean house.'

Musk, along with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, was tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency that aims to 'slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure Federal Agencies.'

A former NASA employee told https://t.co/wltvSpLrgz that NASA's DEI is 'destroying America's ability to compete with China in space because the Biden-Harris administration will only fund programs that feature it.'

NASA receives, on average, about 0.4 percent of what the US government spends each year, but is still given a budget of at least $20 billion.

While the space agency has dished out millions for DEI, it's data showed it generated more than $75.6 billionin economic output across all 50 states and Washington, D.C., in fiscal year 2023.

Yet, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) laid off five percent, 325 employees, of its workforce this week and a previous 530 that were let go in February.

The American space agency began incorporating diversity and equal employment opportunity elements into supervisors' performance plans in 2005 but did not hold leaders fully accountable until 2021.

This shift coincided with the Biden-Harris Administration's executive order,¬†emphasizing diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility within the federal workforce.

A stunning rebuke: Progressive DAs lost 13 of last week's top 25 races, even in deep-blue strongholds. 

In LA, George Gasc√≥n lost by 23 points despite Harris winning the county by 30. 

San Francisco's tough-on-crime DA crushed her progressive opponent two-to-one.

California's Prop 36, restoring tough penalties for drugs and theft, passed with historic 70% support. 

The voter revolt crossed party lines - more than half of Harris voters backed tougher crime measures, rejecting policies championed by Soros-funded prosecutors.

The shift is dramatic: Of roughly 75 Soros-linked DAs identified in 2022, over 30 have left office and 20 have been replaced by traditional prosecutors, from Virginia to Florida.

A deep dive into federal spending reveals some truly jaw-dropping examples of waste that Trump's new DOGE team will tackle:

$1.3B sent to dead people

$171M in benefits to prisoners

$101B in improper Medicare payments

$70B more planned for ""COVID response"" through 2026

The waste gets even more bizarre: $549K for Russian cat experiments, $3.7M to study gambling monkeys, and $20K for drag shows in Ecuador.

""If IRS employees can't figure out how to pay their taxes, how do the rest of us?"" says watchdog CEO John Hart, noting that even IRS workers owed $50M in unpaid taxes.

Corrupt federal officials have quite literally been the architects of an incentive structure in which taxpayers pay them billions of dollars to destroy our nation.

This is why Democrats attempted to hide a $1.4 BILLION allocation just for NGOs in their disastrous border bill. That allocation was set to be disbursed by FEMA to the NGOs if certain metrics were hit such as detention beds being filled.

In other words, all the NGOs had to do to unlock another $1.4 billion is get more people to come here illegally.

Officials such as Mayorkas have been using these organizations such as HAIS for far too long to launder money and rip the fabric of America.

Defund and investigate every last NGO who received any federal funding above $10 million during the Biden-Harris Administration. A lot of people have made a lot of money off of this crisis and it‚Äôs time for transparency.

"üö®üá∫üá∏ THE $35 TRILLION CRISIS: WHY ELON AND VIVEK'S ""DOGE"" IS AMERICA'S LAST CHANCE

Trump has given Elon and Vivek until July 4th, 2026 - America's 250th birthday - to radically transform how our government spends its $6.5 trillion annual budget. 

The timing isn't random - it's a calculated deadline as America faces unprecedented fiscal challenges:

BY THE NUMBERS:

- Debt doubled to $35.46T since 2015

- Interest rates jumped to 3.32%

- Interest payments now exceed $1T annually

- Debt-to-GDP ratio at critical 124%

The DOGE team will have just 18 months to:

- Audit $1.72T in Health & Human Services spending

- Review $1.52T in Social Security expenditures

- Streamline $1.32T in Treasury payments

- Identify waste across all federal agencies

Elon's real-time transparency approach, combined with Vivek's regulatory expertise, aims to deliver ""a smaller Government, with more efficiency and less bureaucracy"" as America's 250th birthday gift. 

With interest payments now exceeding our entire military budget ($826B), the deadline reflects the urgency of our fiscal crisis.

The July 4th, 2026 deadline isn't just patriotic symbolism - it's a race against time to prevent America's fiscal collapse.

"January 6th was Nowhere Near a Violent Insurrection

About an hour into the Town Hall, Elon Musk responded to a man who expressed anger at Trump over January 6th. 

Elon was thoughtful with his response, even mentioning his concern over the media taking a sound bite of something he says and spinning it to fit their narrative. 

Likewise, this is exactly what the media has done to Trump.

Elon's outlook:

""If you've heard something bad about Trump, listen to his whole speech. That's actually very important. On January 6th, his statements on that day, he told people to back down. 

""He said, 'Do not do violence,' but some people said that's actually some sort of dog whistle about doing violence, so I'm like, what are you supposed to say? 

""You know he did actually tell people to not be violent. He recommended that the National Guard be deployed and Nancy Pelosi said No. He did not call for any violence.""

Elon continued (after a few shouts in the audience), saying,

""Obviously, the level of disruption was high and I don't applaud any kind of damage to public property or course, but the media tries to characterize January 6th as some sort of violent insurrection, which is simply not the case. That is false."" 

(the Pennsylvania crowd cheers) 

Elon explains he takes the middle ground on January 6th.

Elon: ""I would take probably what I think is the middle ground, which is I disagree with the level of protest but it was in no way a violent insurrection. There's got to be a lot of guns for it to be a violent insurrection. And there were a lot of strange things.

""There were a lot of irregularities that are hard to explain... there were things that were statistically unlikely, let me put it that way.

""So, it's not as if the January 6th protests had no merit, they had some merit. I disagree with the magnitude of what they did, but it's not as if there were no issues. 

""There were issues, and we have this weird situation in America where it's almost impossible to prove fraud.

Elon: ""Because if you've got no voter ID, and mail-in ballots, how do you prove fraud? And... it does seem more than a little odd that we don't have voter ID and New York and states like California which are supermajority Democrats.

""They passed a law banning voter ID in any election whatsoever. Now, how is that supporting democracy? That's not supporting democracy. That's insane.

""Almost every country on earth has voter ID requirements, but we don't. Why? And why do the same people who demanded vaccine IDs for you to do anything, are the same ones who say 'No ID for voting!' 

""Something doesn't add up. It doesn't add up. So, I actually think... my opinion is... that those who think Trump is a threat to Democracy, are they themselves the threat to democracy.""

Note: On June 28, 2024: The US Supreme Court ruled that many January 6 prosecutions were illegal. Many people held on false charges in jail were set free, and hundreds of charges were dropped.  In a 5-4 decision, the court decided the DOJ abused its power and overused ‚Äúobstruction‚Äù charges on peaceful protestors of J6.

"Elon Musk: Something's wrong with the press. Citizen journalism is the future.

‚ÄúThe far-left press has been going on and on about how Trump is like Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin combined, and you rolled them all into one, and he's somehow worse than all three of them combined. 

These are people who have killed tens of millions of people. Something's wrong with the press, guys. Journalism is dead. What the heck is going on? It's bizarre.

That's why ùïè is the future. It's citizen journalism, where you hear from the people, it's by the people, for the people. That's what it's all about.

I think this is a super, super big deal, and it's absolutely fundamental and transformative that the people actually get to decide the news and the narrative and what matters.

The legacy media is basically controlled by a handful of editors-in-chief. That's it. They decide what's going to get published.

That's why I really encourage everyone out there to write stuff on the ùïè platform and other platforms too. But citizen journalism is the future. That's where you get to hear from actual experts in the field, people who are experts in any given industry. 

And you get to hear the rebuttal. If somebody says something that's wrong or requires more context people can add that. ùïè has got community notes, which is great. Community notes, I think, got a very good batting average. It's not perfect, but it's got a very good batting average.‚Äù

"Just asked Grok about this photo:

The image depicts a Falcon 9 rocket, manufactured by SpaceX, during its launch phase. Here are the combined observations and analysis:

Rocket Design: The Falcon 9 has a sleek, cylindrical design with a pointed nose cone, typical for reducing aerodynamic drag during ascent. Its predominantly white body is characteristic, which helps with thermal control by reflecting sunlight.

Engine and Exhaust Plume: The bright, fiery exhaust plume at the base indicates the engines are firing, with the color and shape suggesting high-temperature exhaust from the rocket's Merlin engines, which use RP-1 and liquid oxygen.

Stage Separation: The visible separation between the upper stage and the lower stage implies the rocket might be in the process of staging, where the first stage separates and the second stage continues the ascent.

Atmospheric Conditions: The clear sky suggests favorable weather conditions for launch, which is typical for SpaceX launches to ensure minimal atmospheric interference.

Launch Phase: The angle and exhaust plume indicate the rocket is in the initial to middle phase of ascent, where it's still in the lower atmosphere, gaining altitude rapidly.

Technology Implications: The Falcon 9 represents advanced aerospace technology, with precise engineering for propulsion, guidance, and control systems. The bright exhaust signifies the high thrust needed for escaping Earth's gravity.

Potential Applications: The Falcon 9 is used for various missions, including satellite deployment into Low Earth Orbit, Geostationary Transfer Orbit, and even crewed missions to the International Space Station.",2024-11-09 06:54:32+00:00

In an industry where only 10% of CEOs in major tech companies are women, Elon chose a proven leader with unmatched reach and impact.

"Elon Musk:¬†The cumulative voice of the people should decide what's newsworthy.

‚ÄúIn times past, we didn't have the technology for this, so the only way to learn news was for it to be filtered through a small number of news organizations and then to be printed in newspapers or broadcast.

There wasn't really any way that people could speak to each other or communicate with each other. But now there is, because people can be online.

I'm a big believer in citizen journalism being actually way better.

At first, citizen journalism may sound like, well, doesn't that mean just a whole bunch of amateurs are doing journalism? No, actually, it's way better because if you have actual experts in the field saying things that's way better than a journalist, if you have people who are actually at the event, live.

Look at the attempted assassination of President Trump, people actually at the event live, doing video, people are reporting it. That's the kind of thing that is actually far better information than filtering it through a small number of publications, which ends up being controlled by maybe five editors-in-chief.

There's like five people that control the news. And even though there are multiple newspapers, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, a few others, they decide what is newsworthy.

"WHY TRUMP WON

While the legacy media has a meltdown searching for hitherto undiagnosed psychoses in the electorate to explain its embrace of a Hitlerian strongman, the truth is much simpler than their fictions. 

This election is a reminder that after all the manufactured drama and overheated rhetoric, politics is still about issues. Whether you agreed with him or not, Trump ran a substantive campaign based on issues like the border, inflation, crime, and war. 

Harris ran on vibes, celebrity endorsements, name-calling (‚Äúconvicted felon‚Äù, ‚Äúfascist‚Äù), debunked hoaxes (‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù), and platitudes (‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù). She would neither defend the Biden-Harris record nor say what she would do differently. When she did talk about specific issues, they were often stolen from Trump (child tax credit; no tax on tips; border funding).

On the one issue where Democrats had an advantage, abortion, Trump deftly got ahead of the issue by rejecting a national ban and removing problematic language from the GOP platform. Harris wore out the issue by blatantly lying about Trump‚Äôs position and by exhibiting her own party‚Äôs extremism (nobody needed to see an abortion truck at the DNC).

While Trump expanded his coalition with MAHA (health) and DOGE (government efficiency), Harris concluded her ersatz campaign by going all in on demonizing her opponent, pretending Madison Square Garden was a Nazi convention. 

The fact that voters saw through it should be reassuring, even if you don‚Äôt agree with the result. Voters want to know how a candidate will give them a better life and, increasingly, they have learned to tune out the rest as noise. 

While the legacy media creates excuses and impugns the motives of voters to explain why Trump won, the reason is simple: Trump is the candidate who spoke to voters‚Äô concerns directly.

"If the election outcome is as I expected, it should cause the large minority of the country who supported @KamalaHarris and predicted her victory to begin to question their sources of truth. 

Half the country has believed that @X is filled with mis- and disinformation, and that they could only therefore rely on The NY Times, MSNBC, CNN and other mainstream media for their news. And they did. 

If, however, you have been active on @X for the last year, you have known the truth days, weeks and often months before the facts appear in the MSM.

The MSM excerpted, clipped and cut to defame @realDonaldTrump while claiming that @JoeBiden was fit as a fiddle. Then when Biden‚Äôs polls collapsed, @KamalaHarris was anointed the candidate and her hagiography was written with glowing acclaim from the press. But this could not hold as she ducked the media and held fast to the teleprompter. 

Citizen journalists with their phone cameras in hand captured the real Kamala forcing her to defend her record and her plans in more media appearances. It did not go well and the public demanded to learn more so @KamalaHarris had to risk more unscripted media. 

The doom loop was underway with perhaps 60 Minutes as one of the more dramatic examples, even after CBS tried to save her, most glaringly by excerpting one answer to replace a word salad response to another. But the citizen journalists on @X quickly caught and outed this fraud and demanded a transcript. 

As many who supported Kamala began to realize that they have been misled, they became open to Trump as an alternative, but they didn‚Äôt want to rely on the media to understand him because they did not want to be misled again. 

They wanted to hear the candidate in his own words and that is where @lexfridman and @joeroganhq long form podcasts came to the rescue. When Kamala was offered the same opportunities to explain herself, she rejected them. And the voting public could only draw a negative inference. 

When the story of this election is written, I expect it will be as much about how half of America woke up to the reality that they have been manipulated by the media. This should lead to an abandonment by many of the MSM as their primary source of information. It will push more people to @X, to podcasts and other empirical sources, and it will lead to a more informed public. 

The other outcome I hope happens is the implosion of the Democratic Party. The Party lied to the American people about the cognitive health and fitness of the president. It prevented, threatened, litigated and otherwise eliminated the ability of other candidates for the primary to compete, to get on ballots, and to even participate in a debate. The Party and the administration used lawfare in an attempt to imprison, bankrupt or otherwise kill off Trump as a candidate. These acts are collectively grave threats to our democracy. With the highest irony in order to hide these acts, the Party accused the opposition candidate of being the grave threat to democracy. 

The Democratic Party proved itself to be fundamentally undemocratic. It needs a complete reboot. The leadership should be thrown out and those responsible should apologize to the American people.

They were like, no, we can't even look at that ID. It's illegal for them to even look at your ID if you want to present it in California. For any election at all even City council.

Joe Rogan: What logical reason other than to cheat would you ever have that law?

Elon: The reason is to cheat, obviously.

Joe: You can never make an argument any other way. And I think 84% of people polled believe that you should show ID to vote. So it's against the will of the people.

Elon: And we are extremely aware we're an outlier in not requiring ID. Basically, almost every country on Earth requires ID to vote.

As soon as you ban ID for voting, it makes fraud impossible to prove, because how do you trace the fraud?‚Äù

And then you would have voters that would be significantly voting towards the Democrats because they're the people that enabled them to come into the country in the first place, first place and provided them with those services.

They‚Äôre all war hawks when they‚Äôre sitting in Washington saying let‚Äôs send 10,000 troops to fight the enemy‚Äù

I thought Democrats have always used this type of example towards Republicans calling for war. Is being anti-war now a bad thing? How are major outlets publishing these types of headlines? Arizona‚Äôs top prosecutor is apparently investigating this as a possible death threat (bruh)

üî•üî•üî•

Dhillon, a fierce critic of woke corporate culture, is now leading the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.

""The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is the federal government‚Äôs prosecutorial arm that basically enforces wokeness. They‚Äôre the ones who have ensured that, for the last decade, these companies have had all these crazy policies under the penalty of being investigated, subpoenaed, and ultimately prosecuted.""

""The most famous case that the current head of the Civil Rights division brought was the case against SpaceX for not hiring enough refugees‚Äînotwithstanding that SpaceX is a military contractor and is not permitted to hire non-American citizens under a separate law.""

""Dhillon is brilliant, and she's the exact opposite of that.""

""Every signal is being sent that they‚Äôre going to do a 180 on all these things, and they‚Äôre going to begin prosecuting companies for violations of civil rights laws in the form of reverse discrimination‚Äîdiscrimination against white people, Asians, Jews, and other unprotected classes.""

""So, signals are being sent by these appointments that there will be an assault to reverse the assault that companies and universities have been under. And then, of course, the Supreme Court ruled not long ago that private universities are not allowed to do race-based admissions.""

""I think every major corporation in the country is just in flagrant violation of actual civil rights law. You cannot have these hard quotas and racially, ethnically, and religiously biased hiring practices. It‚Äôs flat-out illegal.""

""These companies have gone so extreme that they‚Äôve ended up in what I think is clearly mass illegality. So, as Dhillon steps into her job, she won‚Äôt lack a shortage of targets. If you don‚Äôt want to be a target, it‚Äôs a great 'get out of jail free' card to voluntarily shut all this stuff down.""

"To Elom Musk @elonmusk : I believe I recently joined the X platform due to its relatively low usage rate in South Korea. According to Grok 2, which I am currently most satisfied with, as of 2024, the number of X platform users in South Korea is estimated to be approximately 5 million, which is significantly low compared to the country's total population of about 50 million.

The primary cause of this phenomenon seems to be South Korea's somewhat elevated localized intellectual activities. For example, unlike K-pop‚Äôs global appeal, which is not closely related to intellectual activities, Google is estimated to hold only 30% of the search engine market share, while a South Korean company is projected to dominate with roughly 60%. (In contrast, Google is estimated to have a 90% search engine market share in the United States.)

To increase the usage of the X platform in South Korea, I believe South Koreans should strive for more ""globally"" connected intellectual activities, mainly with X as the central platform for this transformation.

"üö®üá∫üá∏ THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT: HOW BIDEN'S HANDLERS RAN AMERICA

While Democrats rage against Elon's ""unelected influence"" for exposing wasteful spending, a recent bombshell report reveals an unprecedented usurpation of executive power: Biden's presidency has been largely run by proxies, with cabinet members rarely gaining direct access to their commander-in-chief.

Even Treasury Secretary Yellen ‚Äì traditionally one of the most important cabinet positions ‚Äì was kept at arm's length, forced to communicate through intermediaries. 

Defense Secretary Austin's regular briefings became increasingly rare, even as wars erupted in Ukraine and Gaza. 

Cabinet members stopped requesting presidential access altogether, knowing such requests would be denied.

This wasn't mere delegation ‚Äì it was institutional coverup. 

Where Obama actively engaged with his cabinet to debate policy, Biden's team created an impenetrable barrier of handlers who issued top-down directives with little presidential involvement.

Yet when Elon used X's transparency to trim a 1,547-page spending bill to 118 pages, these same Democrats decried his ""shadow"" influence. 

The hypocrisy is staggering ‚Äì Washington would rather have unelected staffers secretly running the executive branch than face public scrutiny of its bloated spending.

The message is clear: the establishment will protect its own while fighting those who dare to lift the veil.",2024-12-24 01:00:12+00:00
"Something old and something new in electric propulsion üöÄ
The lower box is one the earliest spacecraft ion thrusters (from EOS circa 1962), and on top is a new arrival, a modern marvel from the SpaceX Starlink satellites used for on orbit maneuvering. SpaceX has mastered Argon Hall Effect thrusters, something no one else has been able to do.  This affords a higher power density (4.2kW in 2.1kg) and much lower cost gas (about $10 per satellite) than prior designs using Krypton or Xenon.  This is one of the early 2023 flight units for@Starlink V2 Mini, and the only one outside the company.

These thrusters are for in-space use only, and while they have relatively low thrust, they can run continuously for long periods with a very high ISP, and they are compact and reliable.  They are commonly used for satellite station keeping and interplanetary missions, where this Argon thruster could reduce a 5-year transit time to months.

The backside of the SpaceX thruster shows how simple it is, with gas lines and wires for the cathode and electrode, insulated with Boron Nitride on the other side and permanent magnets for lensing of the streams.

Ben Longmier, lead designer of the SpaceX thruster, helped identify the old one I had in my collection.  It appears to be ‚Äúa development unit or early flight unit for a Cesium thruster from EOS (Electro-Optical Systems). The black component underneath the thruster looks to be the propellant tank and you can see several heaters wrapped around and brazed in place. A porous plug would have been used as a ‚Äòvalve,‚Äô which takes advantage of a metal wetting and vapor pressure trick to throttle the propellant flow vs. temperature of the porous sintered metal plug.‚Äù

The final EOS thruster design is in the Smithsonian. It was successfully tested twice in space on flights of Air Force Blue Scout missiles in 1964.

Back in 1912, Goddard postulated that high-velocity streams of electrons and positive ions could be ‚Äúenergized‚Äù by solar-electric power supplies to provide thrust for an interplanetary spacecraft.  He went further to suggest that the source of the ions could come from exposing alkaline atoms, such as mercury or cesium, to hot tungsten surfaces.  He was spot on!

And more history from Ben: ‚ÄúOne of the original Peenemunde rocket scientists on Von Braun‚Äôs team was Ernst Stuhlinger, who moved his family to what would become Marshall Spaceflight Center in Alabama. Ernst was close to Von Braun and worked on a lot of the early projects. In the later years of the US space program, both Ernst and Von Braun had dreams of expanding beyond the moon and sending craft deeper into the solar system, specifically Mars. One of Ernst‚Äôs concepts involved solar powered craft that would use Cesium ion thrusters to achieve a very high payload fraction delivered from Earth C3 to Mars injection orbit. This was an early solar electric propulsion concept that would ultimately never fly due to the wind down of budgets.‚Äù

And now, with the modern revival of a Mars program, the SpaceX Marslink satellites take us from dream to dream.

I borrow this phrase form the closing of Andrew Chaiken‚Äôs A Man on the Moon: ‚ÄúHistorians of the far future may look back on Apollo and the missions that are yet to come as one great Age of Space Exploration.  But in my mind‚Äôs eye it is a slow dissolve, from memory to anticipation, from what has been to what will be, from dream to dream.‚Äù",2024-12-24 00:55:35+00:00

‚ÄúElon actually delegates almost everything. He's not involved in most of the things that his companies are doing.¬†

He's involved in the thing that is the biggest problem right now until that thing is fixed. 

And then, he doesn't have to be involved in it anymore, he can go focus on the next thing that's the biggest problem for that company right now.¬†

In manufacturing, there's this concept of the bottleneck. In any manufacturing chain, there's always some bottleneck, something that is keeping the manufacturing line from running the way that it's supposed to. Whatever the bottleneck, it's holding everything up.¬†

The job number one is to remove that bottleneck and get everything flowing again. I think Elon basically has universalized that concept and he basically looks at every company like it's some sort of conceptual assembly line.¬†

I don't need to manage everything else because everything else, by definition, is running better than that. I can go focus on that.¬†

A lot of CEOs, especially non-technical CEOs, would really struggle to implement his method. When he identifies the bottleneck, he goes and he talks to the line engineers who understand the technical nature of the bottleneck.¬†

If it's people on a manufacturing line, he's talking to people directly on the line.¬†Or if that's people in a software development group, he's talking to the people actually writing the code.¬†

He's not asking the VP of Engineering to ask the Director of Engineering to ask the manager to ask the individual contributor to write a report that's to be reviewed in three weeks. He doesn't do that. He would throw them all out of the window. There's just no way he would do that.¬†

He goes and personally finds the engineer who actually has the knowledge about the thing, and then he sits in the room with that engineer and fixes the problem with them.¬†

This is why he inspires such incredible loyalty, especially from the technical people who he works with.

Phoenix A resides at the center of the Phoenix Cluster of galaxies and boasts some truly mind-boggling features:  
- Mass: 24,100 times greater than Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of the Milky Way.  
- Scale: Twice the mass of the entire Triangulum Galaxy, including its dark matter halo.  
- Event Horizon: A Schwarzschild diameter of 590.5 billion kilometers (3,900 AU), roughly 100 times the distance from the Sun to Pluto.  
- Circumference: Traveling around its event horizon at the speed of light would take 71 days and 14 hours.  
- Growth: Gains about 60 times the mass of the Sun every year.  

Given its immense size, Phoenix A might belong to a proposed class of stupendously large black holes ‚Äîprimordial black holes with masses potentially exceeding 100 billion solar masses. Such objects push the boundaries of what we understand about the formation and evolution of black holes, far surpassing the theoretical mass limits of luminous, accreting black holes in spiral galaxies.",2024-12-17 00:40:00+00:00

"FSD V13.2.1, WOW.  It felt like I was controlling the car w/my mind.  It did everything I wanted it to the way I wanted it to...   

I don't know how to describe it other than I think I'm done w/human driving.  I was already having FSD do 80-90% of my drives before on V12.5, this feels like it closed the remaining gap.  Last year was only about 30% of my drives on V11, I think the progression is important to describe.  

With V13.2.1 you feel the reduced latency and improved performance by more human-like acceleration, slowing down, merges, turns - except it's perfect every time and humans are not perfect.

"FIRST IMPRESSIONS WITH FSD v13.2.1

Summary

I approached my first drives with FSD v13.2.1 with pretty high expectations, especially after logging over 2,000 miles with FSD v12.5.6.4, which only had two disengagements. Tonight, I drove about 70 miles with the new version, and I came away even more impressed than I was with v12.5.6.3 and .4!

The Route

Our route took us from my hotel near LAX to The Stand restaurant in Calabasas and back. We decided to venture up into the hills to test how 13.2.1 would handle the twisty roads, along with other challenges like road construction, lane closures, and various other conditions.

Traffic & Road Conditions

The roads were fairly busy tonight which meant more traffic and even more erratic LA drivers sharing the road, especially near LAX. As I mentioned above, we encountered a lane closure up in the hills near Calabasas which made things even more interesting.

What's New & General Commentary

- CRAZY HUMAN DRIVERS: 13.2.1 did a fantastic job holding it's own by keeping its composure, even when it was cut off numerous times by surrounding human drivers. No excessive slowing, no phantom braking, just smooth yet calm & collected throttle / brake control.

- PRECISE CURB HANDLING: One of my big gripes with 12.5.6.x on city streets was that it would sometimes get a little close to curbs and then not correct it's trajectory. Tonight, I noticed several instances with 13.2.1 where it would correct itself if it thought it was getting too close to a curb. It did so smoothly, without any seesawing on the wheel. As someone who doesn't want to rash any wheel, this behavior made me more confident. It mimicked what a human driver would do in similar situations while navigating tight turns.

- SPEED PROFILES FOR ALL SPEED RANGES: Having speed profiles at all speeds made for a smoother experience all around. FSD did seem to do a better job at accelerating up to the speed limit on city streets compared to before however I still think there is room for improvement here (especially on city streets where the speed limit exceeds 40 mph).

- STANDARD SPEED PROFILE UPDATES: I drove solely with the ""Standard"" FSD profile which seemed noticeably more assertive than what I was used to with 12.5.6.3 & .4. By this I mean it was more eager to pass slower traffic and increase its speed >5mph over the limit to better fit in with surrounding traffic. I never felt the lane changes were excessive and instead almost perfectly mirrored how I would have driven the vehicle myself. Unlike with v12.5.6.3 & .4 I never felt the need to switch to the ""Hurry"" speed profile.

- USE OF PASSING LANE: FSD 13.2.1 did exhibit some similar behavior to what I was used to with 12.5.6.x in that it would still stay in the leftmost lane a bit too long, even with traffic directly behind us. I would like to see more work done to increase FSD's awareness of traffic approaching from the rear. Additionally, it should do a better job at proactively moving out of the passing lane when it is safe to do so. Keep in mind this critique is focused on the ""Standard"" speed profile as that is what I used for tonight's drives.

- SLOWING AROUND SEMI TRUCKS: One issue I repeatedly encountered on my trip from Minneapolis to Los Angeles was that 12.5.6.4 (and .3) would noticeably reduce speed when coming alongside Semi Trucks, regardless of the speed differential. This unnecessarily increased the time we spent next to the Semi, which I felt put us more at risk compared to maintaining our speed and quickly passing them. I encountered a few Semi Trucks tonight with 13.2.1, but it wasn't enough to conclude this issue has been resolved just yet. More testing is needed on this one.

- PAUSING AT GREEN LIGHTS: At the start of my first drive with 13.2.1 tonight on city streets, there was one occurrence where the light changed and the intersection seemed clear, yet FSD refused to proceed. After waiting a few seconds with no movement from the car, I intervened by pressing the throttle. I reported this incident, hoping the Tesla AI team can investigate what the car might have perceived.

- SMOOTHNESS: Overall 13.2.1 seemed even more smooth with brake and throttle inputs compared to v12.5.6.x, especially when decelerating after exiting the freeway. As you may recall, 12.5.6.x would often come in a little hot then have to use a bunch of friction brake to complete the stop. With 13.2.1, the car seemed to almost always rely solely on regenerative braking, which was much smoother. More braking input was applied earlier on the exit ramp, resulting in a smoother experience.

- CONSTRUCTION & LANE CLOSURE: As we ascended towards the Top of Topanga Overlook, the right lane was closed, forcing traffic to alternate using the left lane. A construction worker was there, managing traffic with a stop/slow sign. FSD not only detected the hand held stop sign, but immediately adjusted its speed when the worker flipped the sign to ""slow"". The latency in its decision-making was almost real-time. I was certain was going to have to disengage, but when FSD managed the situation flawlessly, I was genuinely speechless. For the entire journey to the overlook, FSD navigated the single open lane without attempting to veer into the closed lane, correctly following the cones. Seriously impressive stuff!

- VOICE COMMANDS: This isn't directly related to FSD but pertains to Tesla OS v2024.39, which seems to include some enhancements to voice commands. Common commands like ""set ride height to medium"" which were often missed, are now recognized on the first attempt. Additionally, the transcription speed has noticeably improved, happening almost instantly compared to the previous awkward pauses. I hope this is a step towards integrating @grok into our Teslas, and if so, it's an encouraging beginning.

Closing Thoughts

It is now apparent that driving manually is no longer a necessity when you get into a Tesla equipped with FSD v13. Even long-time Tesla owners familiar with FSD Beta v10 & v11 might underestimate how capable v13 has become and how closely it resembles a safe human driver. We're at a stage where we're fine tuning comfort levels and seeing hundreds of miles between disengagements. While my critiques aim to further enhance FSD, I believe this version is ready for a broader release, and I hope the Tesla AI team will roll it out to the wider AI4-equipped fleet soon. Great work @Tesla_AI team, you all never cease to amaze me!

"Why Neuralink is the most important company this decade!

@neuralink is delivering life-changing value to humanity and is at an inflection point as goes from being a technology in the lab to people‚Äôs homes this year.

As an investor, we look for transformative innovations ‚Äî where technology redefines our understanding of what‚Äôs possible. Neuralink is not just that life-changing innovation but will deliver uncapped upside potential from here.

Here‚Äôs Why üëá

#1 Where Are We Today?
Over the past century, the Brain Machine Interface (BMI) space has evolved from early breakthroughs such as the introduction of electroencephalography (EEG) in 1924 to groundbreaking animal trials like monkeys playing Pong in 2021. This year Neuralink‚Äôs N1 implant was successfully implanted in multiple humans residing in their homes. 

This is a breakthrough for people with quadriplegia, restoring autonomy by converting neural signals from the motor cortex into digital commands. This allows users to engage with the digital world (move cursors and type through thought alone), communicate via text, email, speech and engage with creative outlets like art and music - ultimately delivering life changing human value. 

Noland Arbaugh, the first participant in Neuralink‚Äôs clinical trial, now plays video games, live streams, and navigates his laptop‚Äîall through the power of his mind. Similarly, Alex, another participant, is designing complex 3D objects using CAD software, unlocking creative potential once thought inaccessible. These stories are not isolated; they are the first chapters in a revolution to restore independence to millions globally.

Reviews from Noland Arbaugh @ModdedQuad,  Neuralink‚Äôs first participant: 
- ‚Äú(Neuralink) has helped me reconnect with the world, my friends, and my family. It's given me the ability to do things on my own again without needing my family at all hours of the day and night.‚Äù 
- ‚ÄúThe biggest thing with comfort is that I can lie in my bed and use (Neuralink). Any other assistive technology had to have someone else help or have me sit up. Sitting causes stress mentally and on my body which would give me pressure sores or spasms. It lets me live on my own time, not needing to have someone adjust me, etc. throughout the day.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI think it should give a lot of people a lot of hope for what this thing can do for them‚Äù 

#2 How does it work?

The N1 is the size of a coin, containing a microprocessor, Bluetooth transmitter, rechargeable battery, and ultra-thin wires with 1,024 electrodes distributed across 64 threads. These highly-flexible, ultra-thin threads are key to minimize damage during implantation. The threads of our implant are so fine that they can't be inserted by the human hand. A surgical robot has been designed to reliably and efficiently insert these threads exactly where they need to be.

Once inserted, the electrodes detect neural signals and translate them into digital commands, transmitted via Bluetooth to external devices. Thinking about moving a cursor triggers corresponding neurons in the motor cortex, enabling precise cursor movement on a screen.

#3 Why Now? 

This year Neuralink‚Äôs patients achieved bandwidth that‚Äôs ~50% of a normal human via the N1 implant. It‚Äôs poised to meet human level bandwidth next year and the team aims to exceed it by the end of the decade. A quick breakdown on why bandwidth matters. Today‚Äôs intelligence operates on three levels:

1‚É£ Limbic Intelligence (‚Äúthinking fast‚Äù ‚Äì primal needs like safety and survival)
2‚É£ Higher-Order Reasoning (‚Äúthinking slow‚Äù ‚Äì complex thought and planning)
3‚É£ Digital Intelligence (enabled by phones, internet, software)

Our reliance on digital intelligence is undeniable. Forgetting your phone feels like losing a limb. Yet, the bottleneck lies in the bandwidth‚Äîthe rate at which information flows between biology and technology. Bandwidth is quantified in Bits Per Second (BPS), as popularized by the late Professor Krishna Shenoy:

1‚É£ Average human output (no devices): 1 BPS
2‚É£ Typing/speaking: ~20 BPS
3‚É£ Peak human performance: ~40 BPS

With BMIs (Brain-Machine Interfaces):
- 2017: Achieved ~2-4 BPS
- 2021: Reached 6.56 BPS
- 2024: Neuralink‚Äôs N1 reached 9.5 BPS
- 2025: Neuralink targets 40 BPS 
- By 2030: Neuralink targets 100 BPS

The advances next year will likely come from two main levers: 1) More electrodes (going from 1024 to 3000) and increased utilization of electrodes (currently N1 utilizes ~10% of the 1024 electrodes and is expected to go as high as 40% next year). 

Achieving near-human bandwidth will help dramatically improve the quality of life for people with special abilities. 

#4 What's Next?

1‚É£ Scaling N1: Neuralink aims for 27 procedures in 2025 and 79 in 2026, expanding the number of users.
2‚É£ Vision Restoration: FDA-approved BMI for vision restoration (‚ÄúBlindsight‚Äù) interacts with the visual cortex to restore basic light and shape perception.
3‚É£ Speech Restoration: Expanding to auditory cortex applications to restore speech capabilities.
Beyond Restoration:
Replace smartphones: BMIs could surpass traditional devices, becoming high-bandwidth interfaces for AI-human interaction.
Augmentation: Enhancing human cognition, memory, and productivity for 100M+ users.

From restoring autonomy for quadriplegics to enhancing human potential, Neuralink will revolutionize how we interact with machines, each other, and the world. It‚Äôs not just catching up to technology by defining the next frontier for humanity.

"Noam Chomsky on the pseudointellectualism of postmodern literary theorists.

""If you look at what's happening, I think it's pretty easy to figure out what's going on. I mean, suppose you're a literary scholar at some elite university or an anthropologist or whatever. If you do your work seriously, that's fine, but you don't get any big prizes for it. On the other hand, you take a look over in the rest of the university, and you got these guys in the physics department and the math department, and they have all kind of complicated theories, which, of course, we can't understand, but they they seem to understand them. And they have principles and they deduce complicated things from the principles and they do experiments, and they find either they work or they don't work.

""And so that's really impressive stuff, so I want to be like that too. So I want to have a theory in in the humanities, you know, literary criticism, anthropology, and so on. There's a field called 'theory.' We're just like the physicists. They talk incomprehensibly, we can talk incomprehensibly. They have big words, we'll have big words. They draw far reaching conclusions, we'll draw far reaching conclusions. We're just as prestigious as they are.

"Elon Musk: We should pass the Great Filters, or eventually we will disappear.

‚ÄúIt's worth reading about the Fermi paradox, because people have thought very hard about this. One of the things is maybe there are these Great Filters, and the civilizations don't pass these Filters.

One of the Filters is do we become a multiplanet species or not? If we do not become a multiplanet species, then eventually, at some point, something will happen to the planet.

Either it will be man-made, or it will be something natural, like a meteor, like whatever killed the dinosaurs, for example.

And then, eventually, the Sun will actually expand and will destroy all life on Earth.

So, if one cares about life on Earth at all, we should care about becoming a multiplanet species and eventually going out there and becoming a multistellar species and having many star systems.

The long-term aims of the company are definitely human transportation.

I think the smart strategy is to first go for cargo delivery, essentially satellite delivery.

"It's hard to convey how unregulated and extreme ""gender medicine"" is compared to literally all other medical practices. 

Consider these two recent cases from different medical fields:

1. Two days ago, a popular YouTube podiatrist known as The Toe Bro had his license suspended for five months for failing to detect toe cancer in a patient that resulted in the patient needing to have the toe amputated.

2. Today, top youth gender doctor, Johanna Olson-Kennedy, faces a lawsuit by a patient who was prescribed puberty blockers at age 12 after just one consultation and without prior therapy. Olson-Kennedy is accused of pressuring the patient‚Äôs parents to consent to the treatment by citing the widely debunked ""suicide myth""‚Äîthat their daughter would likely commit suicide without it. She also authorized cross-sex hormones for the patient at age 13 and wrote a letter of support for the patient's double mastectomy at age 14 that lied about the duration of the patient's transgender identity.

This isn't the first patient Olson-Kennedy has rushed to transition. She has a reputation for advocating the removal of medical safeguards for youth distressed about their sex. 

Despite this, she and many other gender doctors, known for similar extreme practices, continue to practice experimental ""gender-affirming care"" without convincing evidence of benefit and amid a host of known harms.

The Toe Bro made a genuine mistake that resulted in a cancerous toe being amputated, and his license gets suspended for 5 months. Meanwhile, gender doctors like Olson-Kennedy regularly bypass medical safeguards to amputate healthy body parts without sound medical reasons and face no consequences.

"you don‚Äôt fix the declining birth rate with subsidies or financial incentives. 

the ‚Äúkids are too expensive‚Äù argument is a convenient cope. people claiming they can‚Äôt afford children are usually rationalizing deeper issues: they just don‚Äôt want them. having children is as expensive as you choose to make it, and for all of human history, people with far fewer resources managed to raise families.

the problem isn‚Äôt financial; it‚Äôs cultural. 

we live in a society that has systematically psyopped and brainwashed people into believing children are a burden, not a blessing. women are told that motherhood is a sacrifice and a hindrance to their career, as if chasing corporate promotions or vanity metrics is more meaningful than creating life. 
men are infantilized and taught to fear responsibility. worst of all, we‚Äôve cultivated a nihilistic worldview that makes people see no point in building a future.

the solution starts with changing the culture. 

we need to instill pride in people: pride in their ancestry, their legacy, and the future they could create. optimism about what‚Äôs to come has to replace the relentless doomscrolling of modernity. 
kids aren‚Äôt just an ""expense""; they‚Äôre the greatest investment a human can make, and we need to start celebrating that.

in the short term, the most realistic strategy is doubling down on those who already value family. focus on motivating families with 2-3 kids to have one or two more. 
it's much easier to expand a family than to convince couples to start from scratch when they've been ideologically poisoned against the idea.

finally, we need to stop glorifying the miserable, atomized single life and the media narratives that turn parenthood into a joke or tragedy.

2/ the investors/owners create a comp package and majority agree that ONLY if you create $X amount of value within 10 yrs, you‚Äôll be compensated $Y

3/ however, if you do not create $X amount of value, you get paid NOTHING, literally $0

4/ you work your ass off and create $X amount of value within 4 years

5/ a judge rejects the comp package saying it was not fair

6/ the investors/owners re-vote for a second time to re-instate the comp package for you to get paid and majority vote that you should be compensated $Y

7/ same judge rejects it again, saying it is not fair

8/ you are getting paid nothing for your honest, hard work (as of now‚Ä¶)

Is it just me, or does this sound absolutely ridiculous? 

Does this make you want to start a company in the US? 

This is literally what‚Äôs happening to Elon Musk at Tesla right now!",2024-12-03 06:44:18+00:00
"A Delaware judge just overruled a supermajority of shareholders who own Tesla and who voted twice to pay @elonmusk what he‚Äôs worth.¬†

The court‚Äôs decision is wrong, and we‚Äôre going to appeal.

This ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs‚Äô lawyers run Delaware companies rather than their rightful owners ‚Äì the shareholders.",2024-12-02 23:42:07+00:00
